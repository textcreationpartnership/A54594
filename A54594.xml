            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is a Duty of high Concernment unto Chriſtians to be ſearching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Joh. 5. 39.</hi> one part as well as another, all being given by Divine Inſpiration, and profitable to high and glorious Ends. The laſt Prophetical Book would never have obtained the Name and Title of <hi>Revelation,</hi> if an underſtanding of the Mind and Will of God therein had been unattainable. Nor would there ever have been ſuch a precious Promiſe in the Front of it, <hi>Rev. 1. 3. Bleſſed is he that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and they that hear the words of this Propheſie,</hi> if it had been un-intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible. Who ſhould ſhare in this Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if none could arrive at the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what they Read?</p>
            <p>Neither ſhould any take Diſcouragement for this ſearch, becauſe ſome have been miſtaken in their Computations of time; for
<pb facs="tcp:98846:3"/>
they may as well reject the Study of other Scriptures on that account, ſeeing many Wiſe and Learned Men have been groſly miſtaken about great Matters of Eaith, or Doctrines of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Enquiry is the more neceſſary, that at laſt the Truth may be found out. I am not peremptory in fixing the time, but offer different Epocha's with the Grounds, and let theſe or the Event determine which is the Truth: And beſides the Myſtical Numbers, there are other Signs of the times; as, the ſleepineſs of Virgins may ſpeak that the coming of the Bridegroom is not far off, <hi>Mat. 25. 1,</hi> &amp;c. and ſome Events may diſcover what are next to follow, as ſome former Seals open'd, tell us what were yet to come, and ſome Trumpets ſounding, tell us which are next to ſound.</p>
            <p>Alſo know that there are other Matters beſides the times yet to come to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after, even what is already paſt; that we may diſcern what an anſwerableneſs there have been in Events in the ſeveral Ages to what is contained in the Propheſies; which is indeed the great Scope and Deſign of this Diſcourſe to give a diſcovery of.</p>
            <p>Here we may ſee how Propheſies have been turned into Hiſtory. And there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb facs="tcp:98846:3"/>
in this to recompence all the labour of any ſerious Obſerver and Enquirer, and to fill him abundantly with Admiration.</p>
            <p>Here is Matter not only knowable, but of great importance to be known, for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Mark of the Beaſt in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head or hand, openly or ſecretly, are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely threatned, <hi>Rev. 14. 9, 10. They ſhall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, and ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Diſcovery of the Enemies of the Church I accounted neceſſary, elſe what followed would not have been Eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>I confidently conclude the Pope to be the ſecond Two-horned Beaſt, <hi>Rev. 13. 11.</hi> who is the Giver of this Mark, and ſo the leaſt Compliance with him as ſuch is very perilous and deſperately dangerous. That Mark may not only be what I have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mentioned, but may extend to ſome other Act or Badge, Teſſera, Sign of Token which he giveth of their belonging to him.</p>
            <p>As to the Firſt Beaſt, <hi>Rev. 13. 1.</hi> I think him not to be the Pope or Seventh Head, but another perſecuting Beaſt as I have evinced. Herein I confeſs I differ from other
<pb facs="tcp:98846:4"/>
Interpreters, yet I account it the Truth, and this may be a ſalvo for their ſuppoſed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes about the Myſtical Numbers; ſome of them might be righter in their Computations as to the End, than themſelves were aware of, two things (which I have proved) being conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Epocha of the 42 Months and 1260 Days, is to be fetched from a [<hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution</hi>] of the firſt Ten-horned Crowned Beaſt, <hi>Rev. 13. 1, 5.</hi> Not from the Pope, nor from any [<hi>Apoſtacy</hi>] of his, or other Romiſh Corruptions; ſome of which were too early to begin thoſe Days with, <hi>2 Theſſ. 2. 7.</hi> and others too late, if they were to Commence from the very firſt Moment of time when <hi>Rome</hi> loſt the Eſſentials of a true Church, and turned into the Whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the 42 Months and 1260 Days are not expreſſive of the whole time, either of the Beaſts continuance or Dominion: It is a great miſtake to think that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the expiration of thoſe Days, the Beaſt muſt be deſtroyed, or the Churches Trouble come to its End. It's true, the Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth or Wilderneſs-ſtate then ended; but after that, the Witneſſes having finiſhed their Teſtimony, there a is Witneſs-killing
<pb facs="tcp:98846:4"/>
War, and the Death-ſtate of the Witneſſes, and their Reſurrection enſueth, before the reign of the Beaſt cometh to an end, <hi>Rev. 11.</hi> v. 7. to 15.</p>
            <p>As to the 2300 Days, <hi>Dan. 8. 14.</hi> I think they are not Prophetical Days, <hi>i. e.</hi> Years, but Natural Days; not only becauſe expreſſed by Evenings and Mornings, <hi>v. 26.</hi> but becauſe they are limited and confined to the little Horn which groweth on the Hee-goat, <hi>v. 8.</hi> which is declared to be the King of <hi>Grecia,</hi> v. 21. And ſo that Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn was <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who did grow out thence, as, <hi>v. 9.</hi> in the latter time (not of the World, but) of the Four King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms which ſprang from the Grecians, or which that was ſplit into, as, <hi>v. 23.</hi> And this <hi>Antiochus</hi> did take away the daily Sacrifice, and caſt down the Sanctuary, <hi>v. 11, 12.</hi> And it being asked, How long it ſhould be till that was cleanſed, <hi>v. 13.</hi> The afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid days are given as the Anſwer, <hi>v. 14.</hi> And ſutably was the Event, according to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> and the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> which may be eſteemed as other humane Hiſtories, though not as Scripture. For from <hi>Antiochus</hi> firſt Perſecution in his own perſon in the 143 Year of the Greeks to his Death in the 149 Tear, is about that time, <hi>1 Maccab. 1. 20, 21.</hi> and <hi>1 Macc. 6. 16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98846:5"/>Or from <hi>Menelaus,</hi> who intended to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt to the Religion of the Greeks, and had a Licenſe from <hi>Antiochus,</hi> to Erect a place in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the 142 Year, to the time of cleanſing the Sanctuary in the 148 Year, is about 2300 Days, <hi>Joſeph.</hi> lib. 12. c. 6. <hi>1 Maccab. 4. 41, 43, 52.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In vain therefore do many perplex them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſeeking the expiration of theſe 2300 Days in the times of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And if they were ſo many Years, yet they could not begin before the Viſion it ſelf, which hath its firſt Date at the <hi>Ram, Dan. 8. 3.</hi> noting the Kings of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> v. 20. and the firſt Year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was about 528 Years before Chriſt; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could they Commence before that little Horn <hi>Antiochus</hi> did take away the daily Sacrifice, and tread down the Sanctuary, <hi>v. 13, 14.</hi> about <hi>Ann. 167.</hi> before the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of Chriſt, and the reſidue muſt come after, and thus would not expire till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Ann. 2133.</hi> But I conclude, that thoſe 2300 Days did begin and end with <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not abſolutely determine that the Converſion of the Jews will be before the Fall of <hi>Rome;</hi> but offer ſome Reaſons for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98846:5"/>This ſeemeth plain, that the Jews will not return to their own Land, or be called till the Reſurrection of the Witneſſes: For as the time, times and half, and 1260 Days, ſo the three Days and half of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes lying dead, are all of them times of the Gentiles, <hi>Rev. 11. 2, 3, 9.</hi> and it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Luk. 21. 24. They ſhall fall by the edge of the Sword, and ſhall be led away Captive into all Nations, and Jeruſalem ſhall be trodden down;</hi> How long? [<hi>until the times of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles be fulfilled</hi>]. And they are not fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led till the Death of the Witneſſes is over, ſeeing the Gentiles hold them under their death.</p>
            <p>If the Tenth part that falleth at the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes riſing or aſcending, ſhould not be <hi>Rome,</hi> but another of the Ten Horns (as ſome would have it) then ſeeing there is but one blow more after that Triumph, <hi>Rev. 19. 1, 2, &amp;c.</hi> Why may not <hi>Rome</hi> be the <hi>Babylon</hi> that cometh into Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance at the Seventh Vial? let the Event determine.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend to immediate <hi>Revelation,</hi> or ſuch a Spirit of Prediction for the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling things to come; but only compare Scripture with Scripture. I did compoſe this
<pb facs="tcp:98846:6"/>
               <hi>Ann. 1665.</hi> and ſee no Cauſe yet for Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation in the Subſtance; only now I have much abbreviated it, with a few Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and a little Addition eſpecially as to the Number of the Beaſt; and this Review <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath added much to my Confirmation and Satisfaction in theſe things. The Day of the Lord is near, let us exerciſe Faith in Prayer, that if Jeſus Chriſt ſhould come at Midnight, yet we may be always found watching.</p>

Power, or not Chriſtian. It cannot be the Devil himſelf for the deſcription here of his ſeven Heads and ten Horns, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 3. We have otherwiſe expounded of Inſtruments of Satan <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 9, 10. (as <hi>Ezek. 29 3. Jer. 51. v.</hi> 34.) and it aptly agreeth to Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> when there were [<hi>ſeven Crowns</hi>] (Emblems of Majeſty, Supream Power and Soveraignty) and theſe upon the heads. Satan acted like a Dragon by fierce and cruel Perſecutions againſt the Church under Ethnick Emperors before <hi>Ann.</hi> 300. and not long after the Man-child Chriſt (not perſonally conſidered, but myſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Church and Goſpel-adminiſtrations) was brought forth (by his Captain General <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatine</hi> the Great) notwithſtanding all Pagan attempts to deſtroy him, or hinder turning from Paganiſm to Chriſtianity. And ſeveral acts or works of the Dragon or Paganiſh Powers are mentioned. As</p>
               <p>1. <hi>A Dragon War with</hi> Michael, <hi>i. e.</hi> with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, whilſt the Empire was Pagan, <hi>Rev. 12. v. 7. And there was War in Heaven,</hi> Michael <hi>and his Angels, and the Dragon and his Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This War is before the riſing of the Beaſt, and before the 1260 days begin, as appeareth in that he had but ſeven Crowns, and theſe upon the Heads, <hi>v.</hi> 3. whereas upon the Beaſt are ten Crowns, and theſe upon the Horns, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1. and in that in this War the Dragon is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and caſt out, or down, ſo as his place is no more found in Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 7, 8. whereas, had he been then turned Beaſt, he would have been a Conqueror, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was given to him
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98846:9"/>
to make War with the Saints, and to overcome them, and ſhould after have had the ſame place in Heaven as before. It is therefore a War that caſteth the Dragon down from his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Throne and Headſhip, not from his acting in Horns of the Beaſt that is intended. It uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a great Triumph for the erecting or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up at preſent another Kingdom, <hi>Rev. 12. 10. Now is come Salvation and Strength, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our God, and the Power of his Chriſt, for the accuſer of our Brethren is caſt down</hi>—Whereas ſuch a Triumph is inconſiſtent with the Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth Wilderneſs-ſtate of the 1260 days, and cannot be during the Reign of the Beaſt, or till thoſe days are ended, and the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15.</p>
               <p>This War and Triumph is before the Woe to the Inhabiters of the Earth and Sea, <hi>Rev. 12. v. 12. i. e.</hi> probably before the firſt &amp; ſecond Trumpets which fall upon the Earth and Sea, <hi>Rev. 8. v.</hi> 7, 8. and ſo before the 7th Seal, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. and before the ſafe ſealing, <hi>Rev. 7. v.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Therefore this Dragon-War was that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and the Pagans, wherein he had a glorious Victory over <hi>Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Maximinianus</hi> and <hi>Lict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ius,</hi> and this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably agreeth with, or anſwereth to the ſixth Seal, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6 12. to the end: And the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Dragon was enraged at his being caſt down, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. knowing that he had but a ſhort time; for but one Pagan more, <hi>viz. Ju<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lian,</hi> was ever advanced to the enjoyment of the Imperial Throne, and he ruled but two or three years (ſome ſay leſs) a very ſhort time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98846:10"/>Neither doth the mentioning a flying into the Wilderneſs 1260 days before this War, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. argue that the War is after; For, often things are inſerted by way of anticipation, and that mentioned in a former place, which was done after; as divers matters, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. are not in time before thoſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. and here is a ſpecial reaſon for it in the Caſe in hand: For having aſſerted that the Dragon watched to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Man-child, and yet he was brought forth, and was caught up to God, and to his Throne, <hi>i. e.</hi> had ſafety, power, eminent exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and yet the Woman flieth into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for ſo long a time, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, 6. A Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ariſeth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How all this cometh to paſs? and how after ſuch advanceme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> ſhe cometh into the Wilderneſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He anſwereth, by declaring, <hi>that there is a War wherein</hi> Michael <hi>overcometh the Dragon, and ſo the Woman the Church hath advancement;</hi> but the Dragon being enraged raiſeth a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and driveth the Woman into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. (and ſo ſhe was not there before) and it is [into her place] <hi>i. e.</hi> into the place which God had prepared for her, no neceſſity of its implying that ſhe had been in that place before. And let it be obſerved what the provocation was, to that Perſecution; <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 13. And when the Dragon ſaw that he was caſt unto the Earth, he perſecuted the Woman that brought ſorth the Man-child.</hi> Which argueth, that this caſting down the Dragon from his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Seat, and the bringing forth the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> were freſh in memory, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98846:10"/>
not many hundred years before, as they muſt be, if this War were towards the end of the 1260 days, as ſome would have it.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing this War was before the riſing of the Beaſt, and ſeeing the going into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, which next enſued <hi>Michael</hi>'s Victory over the Dragon, is that going into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for a time, times and half, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, 14. Hence that going into the Wilderneſs for 1260 days, is the going into the Wilderneſs for a time, times, and half a time; or theſe are the ſame meaſure of time.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>A Dragon, or Pagan Perſecution</hi> (after the Empire became a Beaſt) <hi>driving the Church into the Wilderneſs, Rev. 12. v.</hi> 13. When the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon ſaw that he was caſt to the Earth, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecured the Woman.</p>
               <p>The Dragon now perſecuted the Church, not by a Headſhip which he was already caſt down from, but in the form of Crowned Horns of the Beaſt, divers of which at firſt were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſh, as the <hi>Goths, Vandals, &amp;c.</hi> And let it be obſerved, that they then did not give their Power to the ſecond Beaſt the Pope (who was not then up) by way of profeſſed ſubjection either to him, or to the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>A Dragon flood caſt out after the Woman the Church,</hi> Rev. 12. 15. A multitude of <hi>Pagans,</hi> as well as Errors, which were dried up, that She was not drowned thereby.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>A New Dragon War raiſed upon this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Remnant of the pureſt Worſhippers,</hi> Rev. 12. 17. I ſhall it to Conſideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this was at the next Perſecution by the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98846:11"/>
Horns, after the Woman was in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Flood was over; or by the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> who over-run the Eaſtern Churches and raiſed Perſecutions there, and although they own God, yet it is in ſo carnal a way, as they deny him by their Religion, and not ſo much as profeſſing Chriſtianity may be deemed Paganiſh, though not profeſſedly <hi>Pagans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the work of the Dragon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church, both before the 1260 days, and in that time.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>A Dragon Combination, as one Partner at the Battle of</hi> Armageddon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 13.

him, which ſhould be found in another, as this firſt Beaſt. I grant that the Pope is the ſecond two Horned Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11, 12. and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian; but I humbly conceive, that there was a firſt Antichriſtian perſecuting Beaſt, up above two hundred years before the ſecond Beaſt aroſe, and ſo before the Pope became the two horned Beaſt, and ſeventh Head.</p>
               <p>Take my Notion under this Rule.</p>
               <p>Rule 2. <hi>That the firſt ten horned Crowned Beaſt is a Civil State of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire, as broken or divided into ten perſecuting Kingdoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For 1. The firſt Beaſt is distinct from the two horned Beast; or theſe are two diſtinct Beaſts, and not barely a double Power Temporal and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical of the ſame Beaſt:</hi> Here are many Notes of Diſtinction. They have a different manner of riſing. One [<hi>out of the Sea,</hi>] Rev. 13. 1. the Other [<hi>out of the Earth,</hi>] v. 11. the former is wounded in one of his Heads, <hi>v.</hi> 3. the latter is another Beaſt, <hi>v.</hi> 1. 11, 14. they are differing in Shape, the firſt hath ten Horns Crowned, <hi>v.</hi> 1. the ſecond hath two Horns, <hi>v.</hi> 11. Nay, the ſecond Beaſt exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all the Power of the firſt Beaſt, and that before him, <hi>i. e.</hi> before the firſt Beaſt, and therefore they are diſtinct, yet ſome part of the time exiſt together, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſecond Beaſt is up before the firſt is down, elſe it could not be [before him:] And hence it cannot be the ſame Beaſt, conſidered as wounded as the firſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98846:12"/>
Beaſt, and as healed as the ſecond Beaſt: For, how could the ſecond Beaſt, as healed, exerciſe the Power of the firſt Beaſt before him as wounded? Seeing the wounded State, as well as that before the wound is paſt, when the healing time cometh, and ſo it could not be [before him] if after the ſecond Beaſt were up, the firſt were not up alſo. How can one act before another, if both be not up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as diſtinct each from other, even ſtill in ſome reſpects? And hence it is evident, that it cannot be limited only to a double Power of the ſame Beaſt; ſeeing whatſoever Power the firſt Beaſt hath, the ſame the ſecond hath alſo; (and ſo the firſt is in ſome degree ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the ſecond) if the firſt Beaſt did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Temporal Power, then ſo did the ſecond alſo; for, the ſecond exerciſeth not only ſome, but all the Power of the firſt Beaſt, <hi>v.</hi> 12. From all which it is evident, that they are two diſtinct Beaſts, and that therefore the firſt Beaſt cannot be the Pope or ſeventh Head. For, there are but ſeven Heads in all, <hi>Rev. 13. 1. Chap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 17. 3, 9. And if the Pope be the firſt Beaſt and ſeventh Head, how can another diſtinct Beaſt come after and exerciſe all the Power of the firſt without making eight Heads? And who ſhould that ſecond Beaſt be after Popes or ſeventh Head, if the Pope be the firſt Beaſt?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>He to whom the Dragon reſigned or gave his Power, Throne and great Authority about the time of Crowning the Horns, he is the firſt Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13. 1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon his Horns ten Crowns.</hi> And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98846:13"/>
                  <hi>v. 2. The Dragon gave him his Power, and his Seat and great Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Pope had not from the Dragon (<hi>i. e.</hi> from <hi>Pagan Rome</hi>) his Throne, Power or Military Forces, nor great Authority, he had the ſame Seat before, and at Crowning the Horns, and therefore the Pope is not the firſt Beaſt, but the Crowned Horns, who had theſe, as <hi>Alaricus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>That which was Head of the</hi> Roman <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, after the riſing of the firſt Beaſt, received a deadly wound, which afterward was healed,</hi> Rev. 13. 1, 2, 3. <hi>I ſaw one of [his</hi>] i. e. <hi>of the Beasts Heads—wounded as it were unto Death.</hi> It was then one of the firſt Beaſts Heads that was wounded, and ſo in his time, after he was up.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Pope cannot be the firſt Beaſt, or the ſeventh Head then, for the Head of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>opes (as it was not up ſo early, as the Crowning of the Horns, ſo) did not receive a deadly wound, he was rather in a riſing than a falling poſture thence forward.</p>
               <p>But there was a manifeſt wound, in the ſixth Head of Emperours by <hi>Alaricus</hi> about <hi>Ann.</hi> 410. and others afterwards, till about <hi>Ann.</hi> 475. in <hi>Augustulus;</hi> that wound was ſo great, that there were no Emperours in the <hi>West,</hi> or at <hi>Rome,</hi> till <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, about <hi>Ann.</hi> 800. when the wound was after a ſort heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, yet it had not the extent of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Empire. The manner and occaſion take thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alaricus</hi> took <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſet up a Mock Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,

that he might bring the Majeſty of the Imperial Scepter into Contempt and Deriſion, he proclaimed Emperour One, whoſe Name was <hi>Attalus,</hi> and the ſame day they carried him up and down the Streets in the habit of an Emperour, and the next day they made him ſerve as a Slave. It's ſaid to be occaſioned thus; <hi>Alaricus</hi> having over-run many places, ſent Meſſengers to <hi>Honorius,</hi> declaring, that if Lands were granted to him and his to dwell in, he would ceaſe ſpoiling of the Country: <hi>Honorius</hi> not knowing how to recover <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> from the <hi>Suevians, Vandals,</hi> &amp;c. giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Alaricus</hi> Power to go into <hi>France,</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this Grant with an Oath. <hi>Alaricus</hi> ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Courſe towards <hi>France, Sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi>—</p>
               <p>And whereas ſome grant that the ſixth Head of Emperours was wounded, and would have the Popes obtaining Headſhip to be the healing.</p>
               <p>I confeſs I underſtand not, how a wound in one Head ſhould be healed by the riſing up of another. I think the wound is never heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs the ſame Head that was wounded, recovereth again. But this is a granting the thing, for it is not a Head of the Dragon, but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98846:14"/>
a Head of the Beaſt that is wounded, <hi>Rev. 13. 3. One of [his] Heads</hi>—and therefore if it be the ſixth Head of Emperours that is wounded, then that firſt Beaſt is not the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> State under the ſeventh Head, but under the ſixth Head of Emperours.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The firſt Beaſt is the Whore-ridden Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 17. 3. <hi>I ſaw a Woman ſit upon a Scarlet-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Beaſt,</hi> v. 4. 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1. Now the Pope is rather carried by the Whore, than the Beaſt that carrieth her, and therefore this Beaſt is not the Pope.</p>
               <p>Nor is the <hi>Turk</hi> this firſt Beaſt, for this Whore doth not ride upon the <hi>Turk,</hi> nor is <hi>Constantinople</hi> the City, which in the days of <hi>John</hi> reigned over the Kings of the Earth; nor did the <hi>Turk</hi> ariſe the ſame hour with the Crowning of the Horns, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12. but hundreds of years after; yet I deny not that the <hi>Turk</hi> may belong to the Beaſt, after he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome Territories belonging to the Horns of the Beaſt. It is therefore a Civil State of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98846:14"/>
Government or State of the Empire came after Popes to make an eighth King?</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, the Chriſtian Emperours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the riſing of the Beaſt. I add, that it was the ſame State of Government under Pagan and Chriſtian Emperours, though the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Actions of Governours were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, both were Emperours. And ſeeing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſixth Head of Emperours, two Beaſts ſo different each from other are mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1, 11. It is to me a wonder, that men ſhould not ſeek a way how the other ſix might by theſe two Beaſts be made up eight Kings. Thus the firſt Beaſt (<hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1.) hath Ten Crowns upon the Horns; or Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, which made a different ſort of Government from the other ſix, and ſo may be deemed a ſeventh King or ſort of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or an eighth, if we will count it after Popes, who maketh another, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. God ſaved <hi>Noah</hi> [the eighth] Perſon; the meaning is, that there were ſeven ſaved beſides <hi>Noah,</hi> he was not the laſt of them in order, but did make up that number. So <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 11. The Beaſt is the eighth, that is, there are ſeven beſides, ſeven others, and ſo with him there are eight. The Beaſt is the eighth in number, not neceſſarily that he is eighth or laſt in order: Hence he a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is ſaid of this Beaſt, it [was, is not, and yet is] <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 8, 11. [was] in its Ten Horns crowned before the deadly Wound, [is not]

               <p>6. <hi>The Pope obtained not any Civil Supremacy over the Empire, till hundreds of years after the Horns were crowned, and ſo after the firſt Beaſt was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And indeed how is it poſſible that Popes ſhould be reckoned a Head of the Roman State or Civil Monarchy, or ſucceed and come in the place and ſtead of the ſixth Head of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, (which was a Civil Head) until they obtain a Civil Supremacy, as Emperors and others had? <hi>

               <p>Indeed there is evidence that a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the crowning of the Horns, yet Emperors were the Supream Head, and the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> ſubordinate or ſubject to them. <hi>Bonifacius</hi> writing to <hi>Honorius,</hi> ſaith [God hath given you the Regiment of worldly things, and the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to me—]</p>

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:98846:15"/>Even the Councils for ſpiritual matters were called by the command of Emperors many years after, as <hi>Phil. Morney</hi> Knight, in his <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> hath largely proved. And claiming Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, or aſpiring after Civil Headſhip, is no obtaining it, any more than <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> his claiming and aſſuming the Title of Univerſal Biſhop about <hi>Anno</hi> 590. did make him Eccleſiaſtical Head over the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in that day. The Temporal Supremacy of the Pope cannot be proved until a long time after, and ſo he could not be the firſt Beaſt. And to ſay that his Eccleſiaſtical Power made him the firſt Beaſt, and his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral the ſecond, is to invert the Order of <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 17. which aſcribeth that to him as a ſecond Beaſt.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>All the other Characters of the firſt Beaſt agree to the Civil State of the Empire with ten Horns crowned perſecuting, and ſo the complex body of them, or as headed by Emperours, make that Beaſt, Rev. 13. v.</hi> 3, 4. When the Wound was healed, then all the World wondred after the Beaſt. <hi>Charles</hi> was called the Great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then he was ſo much admired. And they worſhipped the Beaſt. To [<hi>worſhip</hi>] him is <hi>eidem ſubjici, i. e.</hi> by civil ſubjection to him noted by worſhip, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 7. and 37. 7. and 49. 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 14. Saying, [<hi>Who is like unto the Beaſt? who is able to make War with him?</hi>] So early they admired the Horns of the Beaſt, as the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and their great Power, and others, as <hi>Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Hunns,</hi> who after the death of <hi>Ecius</hi> grew ſo mighty, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98846:16"/>
he overthrew the Imperial General and Army, took many Cities, and was held for the moſt powerful Prince in the World, and was ſo much feared, that <hi>Martianus</hi> the Emperor ſent to ſue for Peace, and ſent him Preſents. See Imper. Hiſtor. and <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7. made War with the Saints.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>It's a mark of Perdition to worſhip the firſt Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13. 8. <hi>but it is not ſo to yield civil ſubjection to Civil Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. 1. <hi>It is not made a mark of Perdition.</hi> The Text doth not ſhew the danger of worſhipping the Beaſt, but deſcribes him by the multitude of Reprobates that are admirers of him. See <hi>Brightman.</hi> Civil ſubjection may lawfully be yielded to the Civil Power of thoſe who are over-much honoured by many who ſhall periſh.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>If a corrupt Religious Worſhip muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (which is not proved) yet this agreeth to the first as a Civil Perſecuting Beast:</hi> For it is a Scarlet-coloured Beaſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> a cruel Perſecutor, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 3. warreth with the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7. a blaſphemer of God, <hi>v.</hi> 6. And divers of the Ten Horns in their firſt riſing were ſuch, being either Pagans, or in Pagan Worſhip, or Arrians, blaſpheming his Name and Tabernacle, <hi>i. e.</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; and latter-ward it was a Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridden Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 7. And to magnifie him in theſe corruptions, or in that wherein he is a Beaſt, is pernicious; yea compliance with him in Perſecution is an evident token of Perdition, <hi>Phil. 1. v.</hi> 28, 29. And thus it may be a mark of Perdition, though the Pope be not the firſt Beaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:98846:16"/>Obj. 2. <hi>There is but one Beaſt mentioned,</hi> Rev. 17. 8. <hi>which is the interpretation of</hi> Rev. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. [Beaſt</hi>] is a name common both to the firſt and ſecond, and ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. may notifie the whole Beaſt-ſtate in diſtinction from Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon-ſtate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. they are ſufficiently diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. and need not be ſo again in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. When compared each with other, they are two Beaſts differenced from each other by many notes of diſtinction, but when differenced from Dragon, both agree in the common name of Beaſt. As <hi>the Roman Monarchy</hi> from firſt to laſt is called <hi>a fourth Beaſt, Dan. 7. v.</hi> 3, 19, 23. yet that will not deny Dragon and Beaſt to be diſtinct each from other part of its time. But their being two is implied, <hi>Rev. 17. v.</hi> 10, 11. There is another, and an eighth, which agrees with the word King in gender, and there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an eighth King (<hi>i. e.</hi> different Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) if there were not two Beaſts.</p>
               <p>In ſhort [<hi>Beast</hi>] without diſtinction may be taken promiſcuouſly either for the firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Beaſt, as the matter enforceth, but it noteth moſt commonly the firſt Beaſt, or whole Roman State after it ceaſed to be under Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, <hi>i. e.</hi> after Pagan Headſhip ended, and may be underſtood either of its after Headſhip, or the complex body of the crowned Horns com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing the Roman Territory, or Provinces in Eaſt and Weſt, the ſame that the Dragon had before.</p>
               <p>But [<hi>Beast</hi>] when with diſtinction is uſually taken for the firſt Beaſt: Thus when [Beaſt and falſe Prophet] are diſtinguiſhed, the falſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98846:17"/>
Prophet is he that worketh Miracles, <hi>Rev. 19. v.</hi> 20. which is the ſecond Beaſt, <hi>Rev. 13. v.</hi> 14. and therefore the Beaſt diſtinguiſhed from him muſt be the firſt Ten-horned Beaſt.</p>
               <p>So <hi>when [Beaſt and Image] are diſtinguiſhed, Rev.</hi> 14 9, 11. and 15. 2. and 16. 2. and 19. 20. and 20. 4. The firſt with Ten Horns crowned is intended by Beaſt, for it is an Image of him that received a Wound by a Sword, and did live, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 14. which was the firſt Beaſt, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 3. not the ſecond. It is the ſecond Beaſt which had power to give life to the Image of the Beaſt, and work Miracles, and that in his ſight, <hi>v.</hi> 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo he cannot be the Beaſt it ſelf whoſe Image is animated, and hath life given to it, and in whoſe ſight thoſe Miracles are wrought, but the firſt.</p>
               <p>Alſo when [<hi>Beast and Woman</hi>] are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. there [Beaſt] ſignifieth the firſt Beaſt, at leaſt till the riſing of the ſeventh Head, and this in ſo many of the Horns as were ridden by the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> after ſhe aroſe, <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>So when [<hi>Beast and Dragon</hi>] are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1. and 16. 13. there [Beaſt] noteth the firſt Beaſt, or ſo many of the Horns as were profeſſedly Chriſtian, and were ridden by the Whore, and [Dragon] noteth ſuch as were not profeſſedly Chriſtian; for we muſt note, that all the Horns of the Beaſt were not of the ſame Spirit or Religion. About the time of their firſt crowning, ſome were <hi>Dragoniſh Pagans, Rev. 12. v.</hi> 13, 14. Others <hi>profeſſedly Christian</hi> and corrupt; ſome <hi>Arrians,</hi> as <hi>Goths, Vandals, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:98846:17"/>
and towards the latter end of the Beaſts Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ſome Horns or Provinces are Drago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, not profeſſedly Chriſtian, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 13.</p>
               <p>The Turk has part of the Territory of the firſt Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1. others are Popiſhly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. By all which it appeareth, that there is no neceſſity that the Pope ſhould be the firſt Beaſt.</p>
               <p>And although herein I differ from other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, yet I am more for them than againſt them, the matter being rightly ſtated, eſpecially ſeeing hereby I extricate them out of many difficulties where they are at a loſs for a ground in their fixing the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Prophetical days on the Pope, which I hereby prove ſhould be taken from another Beaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The firſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Ten-horned, crowned, perſecuting Beaſt.</p>

               <p>The firſt Horn of [<hi>Eccleſiastical Power</hi>] aroſe in the time of <hi>Phocas Anno</hi> 606. who made <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> the Third Univerſal Biſhop.

               <p>His <hi>Temporal Power and Headſhip</hi> muſt have its firſt date either from the Donation of <hi>Rome</hi> to him (which of old was the Imperial Seat) or from his obtaining Superiority either over the Head of Emperors, or over ſome of the Ten Horns.</p>
               <p>Now, about <hi>Ann.</hi> 725. the City of <hi>Rome</hi> came under the Power of the Pope. <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperor forbidding the uſe of Images in Churches, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> forbad the Tribute of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Rome: Removit Roman, &amp; Italiam, nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non &amp; omnia reip. quam Eccleſiaſtica jura in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperiis ab obedientia Leonis &amp; Imperii ſub ipſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituti—Romam cum tota Italia ab illius Imperio recedere faciens—Paul.

pretended Donation of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, was but a fiction, they belonging to the Eaſtern Empire till now they were uſurped by the Pope, who made himſelf Prince of <hi>Rome:</hi> And afterward Pope <hi>Zechary</hi> depoſing <hi>Childerick,</hi> ſet up <hi>Pipinus</hi> the French King, who in requital compelled <hi>Aiſtulphus</hi> King of the Lumbards to reſtore all the Towns and Lands which he had taken, and by his Donation beſtowed on him the Exarchate or Princedom of <hi>Ravenna</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> and a very large Dominion and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion which afterwards were confirmed by others, with Additions, as by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great <hi>Anno</hi> 800.</p>
               <p>All which argue that now the Pope was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not only a Temporal Prince by the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Rome</hi>—but by getting power over ſome of the Crowned Horns, and oppoſing and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topping Emperours ſo as without their conſent, by degrees, they had their elections, and ſwelled in their power, till at laſt they diſannulled the Inauguration, placing and diſplacing Emperours at their pleaſure. This appeared moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly <hi>in</hi> Hildebrand <hi>or</hi> Gregory <hi>the Seventh, Ann.</hi> 1073. who not only Excommunicated <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperour, but depoſed him, and gave away his Kingdom to <hi>Rodolphus</hi> Duke of <hi>Suevia.</hi> And now Emperours had their confirmation from Popes whereas of old the Popes had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation from the Emperours.

               <p>4. <hi>He exerciſeth all the Power of the firſt Beaſt before him, and cauſeth the Earth to worſhip the firſt Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13. 12. This the Pope doth by letting none be Emperours without his confirmation, depoſing Emperours, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Imperial Crown to others; as <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> ſetting up perſecuting Emperours at his pleaſure, and cauſing the Earth to obey their decrees, by influencing the Horns to perſecute: As Pope <hi>Martin</hi> perceiving the Goſpel prevailed in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> ſtirred up the Emperour and German Princes to making War againſt the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and thus exerciſed the power of the firſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Beaſt, and cauſed Earthly men to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him.</p>

So the Pope as a falſe Prophet</hi> pretendeth to Miracles. One ſaith that the garments of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi> after his death wrought Miracles.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Benno</hi> (who lived at the ſame time) ſaith of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> that when he liſt he would ſhake his Skirts and fire would come out like ſparks, and by ſuch Miracles he abuſed the eyes of ſimple People; and therefore when

the Devil could not perſecute publickly Jeſus Chriſt by Painims, he diſpoſed himſelf fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to deſtroy his name by this falſe Monk, under the ſhew and colour of Religion.

               <p>What this [Image] is, it is a great queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
               <p>It muſt be an [Image] not of the ſecond, but of the firſt Beaſt that was Wounded, <hi>v.</hi> 14. and ſo it is not the firſt Beaſt it ſelf (and the rather becauſe the Beaſt and Image are made diſtinct, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 9.) but a repreſentation or reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of him, yet ſuch as the falſe Miracles were to win Credit and Honour to this Image, <hi>v.</hi> 14. ſaying that they ſhould make an Image—(which in making is [to] when once made [of] the Beaſt, <hi>v.</hi> 15.) or that he had made it, and he urgeth worſhipping of it upon pain of death, <hi>v.</hi> 15.</p>

               <p>Therefore this [Image] muſt be either <hi>the Pope himſelf,</hi> or <hi>ſome new Conſtitution of his,</hi> or elſe the German Empire.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth not to be this ſecond Beaſt or Pope himſelf, for he maketh it, and ſo is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and is not it that is made, unleſs it noteth his exciting or cauſing others to give Imperial Honour and Dignity to him.</p>

               <p>I cannot aſſent to the way of learned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Mr. <hi>Potter,</hi> making the ſquare root of 25 the Beaſts number; for few Chriſtians are ſuch Arithmeticians as to find out the myſtery by the extraction of Roots, nor are they oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſuch; whereas all Chriſtians are bound to count and apply this number, ſo as to avoid compliance with the Beaſt or being of his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, [<hi>Here is Wiſdom let him that hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Count.</hi>—]</p>
               <p>And that we may find out the true meaning of this difficult Text, obſerve; it is [<hi>the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Beaſt</hi>] not only [<hi>the number of his name</hi>] (which ſome confound with it) but of the Beaſt himſelf, which is diſtinct from the name, <hi>Rev. 15. 1. Victory over the Beaſt is one thing, and over the number of his name is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And it is known by computation [<hi>let him—count</hi>] it muſt then be found out by reckoning or counting, and ſo is a real number. And it is [<hi>The number of a Man</hi>] i. e. common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in uſe among men as, <hi>Rev. 21. 17. [The meaſure of a man</hi>] is that which man is wont to uſe, and ſo it muſt not be a myſtical, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical number, a day being put for a year as elſewhere in this propheſy, but the very num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 666.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:98846:23"/>It remaineth then that it muſt (according to Scripture denote <hi>either the number of perſons</hi> the followers of the Beaſt, <hi>or elſe a number of his years a time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be a deſcription of the Beaſt by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his followers, it is applied to him not as if they were preciſely ſo many, for it is known they are many, many more in Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and People; but as an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite number to that of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14 1. and there 144000 is fixed on, not for its own ſake, but for the ſake of 12 as the Baſis of it, for it is not imaginable that every Tribe parcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out (<hi>Rev.</hi> 7.) had exactly 12000. But 12 is befitted to all the concernments of the Lamb both great and ſmall, all matters of Faith and Worſhip are meaſured by 12 the doctrine of the 12 Apoſtles, hence ſo many things run upon 12. as <hi>Rev. 21. v.</hi> 12, 14, 17, 19, 20, 21. there 12 Angels, 12 Gates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwerably the number of the Beaſt 666 is choſen for the ſake of ſix, which is diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to 12 the number of the Lamb, and can neither by Multiplication or Diviſion be reduced to 12 the Apoſtolical number; the Beaſt (ſome obſerve) had ſix books of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals, and his matters great and ſmall in Faith and Worſhip are not ſquared by the Rule of the Scriptures or the 12 Apoſtles, and ſo run upon ſix an oppoſite number.</p>

Beast,</hi> yet cannot denote the whole time of his duration, for I have evidenced that he hath already been up longer than ſo in both his Horns of Spiritual and temporal power.</p>
               <p>Some refer it to the time of his beginning others to the time of his end.</p>
               <p>Of the former ſort, Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> finding that the Pope had his Title of Univerſal Biſhop, <hi>Ann.</hi> 606. looketh back 60 years before Chriſt, when the Romans ſubdued the Church of the Jews, to make up the number.</p>
               <p>But I cannot aſſent to it, for as I cannot find any Scripture where numbering applied to any perſon referreth to the beginning, but to the end, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 26. God hath [numbred] thy Kingdom and finiſhed it; ſo I ſee no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for Faith to count from that Epocha of the Romans or <hi>Pompey.</hi> 666. is none of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> numbers, nor is there a ſyllable in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation putting upon counting thence; rather the contrary, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 1. The things were to come, therefore it is wholly groundleſs. If it muſt note the time when the Beaſt began, I ſhould much rather take the Epocha from the time of <hi>John</hi>'s writing the Revelation in <hi>Patmos,</hi> about <hi>Ann.</hi> 89 and add 666. it bringeth us to <hi>Ann.</hi> 755. about which time ſome think the Pope obtained from <hi>Pepin</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> his ſecond horn of Temporal Power and began to be an Earthly Prince, and ſo became a two-horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beaſt.</p>
               <p>Some referring it to the time of his Fall had raiſed expectations on the year 1666. ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that <hi>John</hi> left out the Millenary number,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98846:24"/>
but time hath confuted this, that year being paſt and he not fallen; unleſs you will begin either at the Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, or the time of writing the Revelation, which yet is ungrounded.</p>
               <p>I rather think it referreth to the time of his End, for the reaſon aforeſaid from <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 26. and that the Epocha of the 666 when it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth is <hi>not from the firſt riſing of the Beaſt, but from his firſt marking time:</hi> from the Beaſts ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War with the firſt reformed Churches, or firſt cauſing his followers to receive a Mark in their forehead or hand, a note of diſtinction of the Beſtians from the oppoſite party appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt him openly with the Lamb in <hi>Mount Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None that I know of have obſerved this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet methinks the Text it ſelf giveth great countenance to it; for immediately after he had mentioned cauſing thoſe that would not Worſhip the Image of the Beaſt [<hi>to be killed</hi>] Rev. 13. 15. (which is by his Warring againſt them) and his [<hi>cauſing all his to receive a mark in their Foreheads or Right-hand</hi>] v. 16, 17. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately it follows [<hi>Here is Wiſdom—count the number of the Beaſt</hi>—] i. e. count from this time <hi>of his open marking</hi> his followers to difference them from others, and thence to the time of his fall or of receiving ſome deadly blow will be 666 years.</p>
               <p>And further to confirm this, as the next thing after mentioning the mark and number of the Beaſt, he ſubjoineth or addeth by way of oppoſition as of the ſame time that an oppo

And I looked, and lo a lamb ſtood on Mount ion and with him 144000. having his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name written on their foreheads.</hi> So that this referreth not to the time when a few, but a vaſt number appeared for Chriſt, even 144000 and not privately, but publickly in Sion, in the Church, with the Fathers name upon their foreheads, and not when they were firſt ſealed, but when they made the firſt open ſeparation from the Beaſt, and appeared for the reſtoration of the Church. It is when they rejoice with ſinging for redemption from, and victory over Antichriſtian Pollutions, <hi>v</hi> 2, 3, 4. which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt be at the beginning time of pouring out the Vials, for then a like Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Lamb is ſung upon the ſame account, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3. for victory over the Beaſt, his Image and Mark and the number of his Name—it was then after ſome getting out of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Egypt.</hi> So that the impoſing the Mark of the Beaſt and the Churches firſt reſtoration by the Fathers name on their foreheads in an open profeſſion are of the ſame date, beginning at the firſt Vial and thence the number of the Beaſt is 666 years to the time of his Fall.</p>

               <p>Rule 4. <hi>THAT the Two-Horned Beaſt the Pope is the Little Horn,</hi> Dan. 7.</p>
               <p>Note that there is a little Horn, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 5, 9. growing on the Hee-Goat, which is expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there ſaid to be the King of <hi>Graecia, v.</hi> 21. that Horn is <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Little Horn, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. groweth on another Beaſt, the fourth Monarchy, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 19, 20, 24. and all the Characters of him agree to the Pope; therefore he is that Little Horn.</p>
               <p>As the Pope in his Original or Riſe was [a little Horn] <hi>v.</hi> 8. a poor Biſhop, yet grew in his looks more ſtout than his fellows, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 25. he did grow up among the ten Horns, and was diverſe from them, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 24. Another had Eyes like a Man, <hi>i. e.</hi> full of Policy and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, hath a mouth ſpeaking great things againſt the Moſt High. <hi>v.</hi> 8. 11, 25. making himſelf ſupream Judge in matters of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Vice God. He Warreth with the Saints by Perſecutions, and prevaileth, <hi>v.</hi> 21. weareth out the Saints, as a Garment, by long rubbing, fretting and ill uſing of them. And he thinketh to change Times and Laws, <hi>i. e.</hi> change Gods Laws for his own, as in Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in Marriages, Meats, Feſtivals—all which obviouſly agree to the Pope; and alſo,</p>

               <p>This agreeth to the Pope; for, he was a means of rooting out the Grecian Exarchs, the <hi>Lombards</hi> and alſo the <hi>Goths,</hi> who ruled in <hi>Italy</hi> and had Soveraignty over <hi>Rome; Silverius</hi> the Biſhop brought this to paſs ſaith <hi>Evagr. l. 4. c.</hi> 18. and theſe were preciſely three; and this doth not leſſen the number of Horns, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to ſeven, but giveth him more Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at <hi>Rome.</hi> Or Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> thinketh they were three Mahumetan Kings, <hi>viz. Solyman</hi> in <hi>Aſia, Caſſianus</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> the Egyptian <hi>Caliph</hi> in <hi>Judea,</hi> which were ſubdued by the Pope who raiſed the War, and this was one of the greateſt acts that ever he did, and theſe are preciſely three, and properly ſubdued by him, and theſe were of the Ten Horns or their Territory belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Daniels</hi> fourth Beaſt.</p>

               <p>2. <hi>When the Body of the Roman Empire was changed from its Ancient form of Provinces, into the form and ſhape of Crowned Horns; then the Beaſt was up:</hi> For it's ſaid in the days of <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 17. 17. They have received no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as yet, but receive power as Kings one hour, or the firſt hour with the Beaſt.</p>
               <p>The riſing then of the Beaſt and the crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Horns, are about the ſame time. This Beaſt is differenced thus from the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, that he, the Beaſt, hath his Crowns (Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of Soveraignty) upon his Horns, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1. and from the two Horned Beaſt, that he hath more than two, even Ten, [and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Horns Ten Crowns.]</p>
               <p>Not that they muſt all be up firſt, ſo as the riſing of the tenth Horn ſhould give the firſt date to the Beaſt: For they are all Horns of the Beaſt; and therefore ſpeak a Beaſt up for them to grow upon, and they receive Power as Kings: [<hi>One hour with the Beaſt,] Rev. 17. v.</hi> 12. Not the Beaſt one hour with them, intimating the Beaſt to be firſt in order rather than otherwiſe. But as the Dragon is ſaid to have ſeven Heads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 3. When as the ſeventh Head of Popes was not up till Dragon (Pagan Power) was down; ſo as well
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98846:28"/>
may this be called a Ten Horned Crowned Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1. Before all the ten were Crowned, becauſe there were to be ſo many principal ones; and ten may not be taken pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, neither more nor fewer, but indefinitely for many, as <hi>Numb. 14. 22. Job. 19. 3. Gen.</hi> 31. 7.</p>
               <p>Now before <hi>Ann.</hi> 400. diverſe Horns were Crowned, ſee an Elaborate book Entituled Antichriſts Excidium, which proveth the riſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Kingdom of the <hi>Alemanes Ann.</hi> 356. the <hi>Oſtrogoths Ann.</hi> 377. the <hi>Viſogoths Ann.</hi> 378. the <hi>Hunns Ann.</hi> 378. and others even ten about <hi>Ann.</hi> 410.</p>
               <p>Therefore then the Beaſt was up.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>When the Dragon gave unto Crowned Horns in the Roman Empire, his Power, Throne and great Authority, then the Beaſt was up:</hi> For it is the Beaſt he gave theſe to, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 2. the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon gave him (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Beaſt) his [power, <gap reason="foreign">

[and great Authority] ſo as to become a lawful ruler within the Roman Empire.</p>
               <p>Now all this was given before, or ſoon after, <hi>Ann.</hi> 400. For Crowned Horns had [power] ſuch military power as they did wage War with the Emperours, as the <hi>Goths</hi> and others, and after the death of <hi>Valens</hi> they over-run <hi>Thracia</hi> and ſpread themſelves even to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and beſieged that. <hi>Am.

It is true this was a little after <hi>Ann.</hi> 400. But it prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Beaſt to be up before, having ſuch great power as aforeſaid. It is true <hi>Alaricus</hi> then did not keep <hi>Rome</hi> long, but then he took poſſeſſion of the Throne: And it is not ſaid the Beaſt [kept] the Throne, but that the Dragon [gave] it to him, and afterward alſo <hi>Genſericus</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> ſacked <hi>Rome.</hi> And after the <hi>Goths</hi> reigned over <hi>Italy</hi> about 70 years.</p>
               <p>Yea Crowned Horns obtained in the Roman Empire [<hi>great Authority</hi>] for before <hi>Ann. 400.

that received not only Power, but Authority in the Roman Empire. I might mention other Leagues, as between the Emperour <hi>Honorius</hi> and the <hi>Goths,</hi> and ſo with <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. All this argueth that the Beaſt was up before <hi>Ann.</hi> 400.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>When the deadly wound was given to one of the Heads, then the Beaſt was up;</hi> For it was a Head of the Ten-Horned Beaſt that was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it were unto death, <hi>Rev. 13. v.</hi> 1, 2. And ſo the Beaſt muſt then exiſt and be up to receive the wound.</p>
               <p>Now this deadly wound was made when <hi>Alaricus</hi> ſacked <hi>Rome,</hi> and perfected at <hi>Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus.</hi> Indeed this act was after <hi>Ann.</hi> 400. but it preſuppoſeth the Beaſt to be up, and ſo we may reckon that he did riſe before <hi>Ann.</hi> 400. And here note</p>
               <p>1. It is not the Pope, but this ten Horned Beaſt, who in reſpect of his firſt State is ſaid to continue [a ſhort ſpace,] <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 10. For it is not ſaid the ſeventh Head, but [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> another] <hi>i. e.</hi> another of the eight Kings (with whom the word agreeth) not another Head. There were eight Kings, and but ſeven Heads, this was another King, or State of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment when the Empire was ſo broken and changed from its antient form and ſhape of Provinces, into crowned Horns, and this was but [a ſhort time] before it was wounded even unto death; Whereas the ſeventh Head, the Pope, hath continued a longer time, than any of the other Heads if compared with them. And further to confirm this, he immediately
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98846:29"/>
addeth the different States of the firſt Beaſt, <hi>v.</hi> 11. [<hi>was, and is not, and yet is</hi>] as before, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and ſo [<hi>was</hi>] is before wounding this ſhort ſpace, [<hi>is not</hi>] is when wounded, [<hi>yet is</hi>] is after healed.</p>
               <p>2. If the firſt Beaſt be [the man of ſin,] 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 6, 7. Then the [lett] which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, not meerly his riſing, but his revelation, muſt be imperial power, which was removed by the aforementioned breakings and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of it.</p>
               <p>But if it be the ſecond Beaſt, then the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is their Imperial Authority, and it was removed when Popes over-topped and aſſumed power over Emperours, as <hi>Hildebrand</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Rule 6. <hi>That the Eaſtern parts belong to the firſt Ten-Horned Beaſt as well as the Weſtern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is denyed by ſome, but ſeeing it condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to the clearing up of truths, and ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial points, I ſhall give theſe grounds of it.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The ſame Dominion which the Dragon (i. e. Pagan Emperours) had, the ſame the Beaſt hath:</hi> Compare <hi>Rev. 12. 2. and 13. v.</hi> 2. He is Succeſſor to the Dragon; with the ſame number of Seven Heads, and Ten Horns, all the Conſtitutive parts.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing undenyably the Dragon had the Eaſtern Empire as well as the Weſt, ſo muſt the Beaſt have, the whole territory al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:98846:30"/>2. <hi>There were Crowned Horns in the Eaſtern parts, as is undeniable;</hi> and this differenceth the Beaſt from the Dragon; compare <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 3. and 13. 1. and 17. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 12. That Crowned Horns over-ran the Eaſtern Empire, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> is before proved; and theſe acted in perſecution, the work of the Beaſt.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The East and West made but one undivided Empire, till after Horns of the Beast were up in</hi> Valens <hi>time:</hi> though <hi>Valentinian</hi> was aſſociated with him, yet the Empire was one till divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> and diverſe Horns up.</p>
               <p>Yea when the Woman fleeth into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. it is upon the two Wings of the Eagle, the Eaſt and Weſt Roman Empire. It will be hard to aſſert that there might have been a Roman Empire diſtinct from the Beaſt at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The irruption of the Turks into the Eastern parts, or ſixth Trumpet,</hi> Rev. 9. 14, 15. <hi>ſhould not have had the Beaſt as the proper ſubject thereof, if the Eastern parts had not belonged to the Beaſt,</hi> where this Tragedy was principally acted. Whereas the Lord expected the Beaſts Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his Idolatry and Perſecution; as the iſſue thereof, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>How could the act of an Eaſtern Emperour</hi> Phocas, <hi>make Boniface 3 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop;</hi> if the Eaſtern Empire did not belong to the firſt or ſecond Beaſt, or both? for both have the ſame Power <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 12. as to extent.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>The ſeventh head of Popes did extend their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98846:30"/>
Power into the Eaſtern parts;</hi> witneſs not only <hi>Victor</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> his Excommunicating all <hi>Aſia</hi> about the obſervation of <hi>Eaſter. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat. lib. 5. c. 21. Greek</hi> 27. but alſo from that which is called the Holy War, chiefly raiſed by the Pope; and from his Excommunicating the Grecians, upon the account of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between them and the Latin Church about <hi>Anſelms</hi> time: and the Greek Church and the Latin Church, were in ſome mean agreement under ſubjection to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> until the time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> IX. <hi>Ann.</hi> 1230. ſaith <hi>Fox</hi> Acts and Monuments, <hi>Vol. 1. p.</hi> 244, 365. and then were diſſevered from them.</p>
               <p>But it is objected againſt the Grecian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire belonging to the Beaſt, as followeth.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>The Greek Empire was up long before the deadly wound, out of which the ſeventh head with ten horns aroſe, and ſo that cannot be of the Ten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>This laboureth with or is built upon a double miſtake,</hi> viz. that this Beaſt cannot be up before the deadly wound; whereas it was the Beaſt that was wounded, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 3. and ſo muſt be up before to receive the Wound. Another miſtake is, that the ſeventh Head did ariſe at the ſame time with the ten Horns, which I deny, ſee <hi>Rule</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>The Ten Kings receive power the ſame hour with the Beaſt: but the Greek Empire aroſe near 100 years before, and ſo is none of the Ten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>When the Roman Empire in its other parts changed its antient form, and was divided into
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98846:31"/>
Crowned Horns, then the ſame hour the Grecian Empire was changed from what it was before:</hi> now it had a new diſtinct Soveraignty of its own, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dependence on the reſt of the Empire as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and ſo thence might be deemed one of the ten Horns; eſpecially ſeeing ſome of thoſe Horns made ſuch Incurſions into the Eaſtern parts, as is before diſcovered. If the <hi>Alemanes</hi> aroſe <hi>Ann.</hi> 356. why might not another be up a little ſooner? Some of them received power as Kings, the ſame hour with the Beaſt, and that is enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 16.</p>
               <p>Obj. 3. <hi>The Greek Empire often withſtood the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>and ſo did not give his power to the Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 17. 12.</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>This firſt Beaſt I proved is not the Pope, but a Civil perſecuting Beaſt;</hi> and the Eaſtern Empire had its ſhare in the Work of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> and others. Yea the Greek Churches we heard did for ſome time give their power to the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further, in the time of the Lutheran Reformation, many Churches were planted in <hi>Germany, England, Scotland, France, Flanders, Denmark, Switzerland, Poland, Hungary,</hi> ſo that diverſe of the Weſtern Princes and Kingdoms, withſtood the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet that will not prove that they never were of the ten Horns, the like may be ſaid of the Grecian Empire.</p>
               <p>And further, as the ten Horns are ſaid to hate the Whore, and Burn her with Fire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12. when onely ſome of them do it; not all, for there are others who committed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with her, that lament her burning,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98846:31"/>
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 18 9. which ſeemeth to intimate, that thoſe who deſtroy her had not lately committed Fornication with her. However it argueth there is no neceſſity that every Horn ſhould give power always to the Beaſt, and the Greek Empire may be of that number; which alſo anſwereth the next objection.</p>
               <p>Obj. 4. <hi>If the Greek Empire were among the Ten Horns, then it muſt laſt 1260 years; Whereas it came into the hands of the Turks before it had been up ſuch a time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>No neceſſity that there ſhould be preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ten Horns, neither more nor fewer, and that every one of theſe ſhould laſt 1260 years, either in the ſame place, Rule or Religion, as at firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſufficient that the Body of them, or ſome continue ſo long in the work of the Beaſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. The <hi>Goths</hi> ruled a long time in <hi>Italy,</hi> and then were expelled thence, yet that is one of the Ten Horns ſtill; at firſt ſome of the Horns were Pagans, others Arians, others ſince Popiſh, others became Proteſtants, fell off from <hi>Rome,</hi> did not continue 1260. Some of the Horns at laſt muſt be of another Spirit, ſo oppoſite as to hate and deſtroy the Whore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12. In ſhort, the whole Roman Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, as of old, in Eaſt and Weſt, make the boundary of the Ten Horns, and ſo the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians make one Horn; though the Greek Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire be at an end, yet thoſe that are or rule there make the Horn.</p>
               <p>The concluſion then is, that the <hi>quondam</hi> Eaſtern Empire, or Eaſtern parts, belong to the Ten Horns, ſome of them may be found
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98846:32"/>
there; and ſo thoſe three Horns, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 8. might be there, and perſecutions there may make the Epocha of the 1260 days, and ſome Eaſtern Powers (though not under the notion of a Grecian Empire, as before) may hate the Whore, and Burn her with fire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 16. or have a hand in her deſtruction.</p>

               <p>Here I muſt premiſe, or take three things for granted.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That thoſe various numbers are the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of time diverſely computed, they begin and end together:</hi> for as the Witneſſes Prophecying in ſackcloth is 1260 days, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 3. So the cauſe or means of it was the Gentiles treading the Holy City under foot 42 months, <hi>v.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being reſolved into days (30 days to every month) is the ſame time. And as the Womans being in the Wilderneſs is ſaid to be 1260 days, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6. So the ſame Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtate is expreſſed, <hi>v.</hi> 14. by the time, times, and half, and one being reſolved into the other explaineth <hi>Dan. 7. v.</hi> 25. and 12. 7. which otherwiſe would have remained very dark; now plainly [time] is a Prophetical year; [times] two years, and [half] half a

year, (as <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23, 25, 32.) which is the ſame with 1260 years. And the Beaſt alſo having 42 months aſſigned to him for like work, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 5. it ſtrongly proveth that all theſe are equal numbers, and of the ſame date.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That they are not taken indefinitely for an uncertain or long time, but definitely, for a certain determined time:</hi> For though round numbers, as 10, 100. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be indeterminately uſed, yet ſuch broken numbers cannot be ſo taken for an uncertain time, without ſpecial reaſon enforcing it. And ſeeing three ſeveral expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are uſed five times (<hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2, 3. and 12. 6, 14. and 13. 5.) to ſet forth the ſame ſpace of time, and all of them broken num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, it muſt be a certain definite time; elſe why is it 1260, and not 2000 days, or 42 months, rather than 40 or 60. or time, times, and half, rather than four times? and what difference were there between the 1290 and the 1335 days, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11, 12. or how could a head of account be laid down, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely in anſwer to that queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>v.</hi> 6. how long ſhall it be to the end of theſe Wonders, if they were an uncertain number which no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count could be made up from?</p>
               <p>3. <hi>That they are not Natural or Common Days or Months, but Prophetical, every day noting a Year;</hi> as <hi>Numb. 14. 33, 34. Ezek. 4. 5, 6. Dan.</hi> 4. 16, 23, 25, 32. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25, 26, 27. which laſt are 70 Weeks of Years reaching to the Meſſias; when natural days are intended there is a note of diſtinction, as of Evenings and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98846:33"/>
Mornings, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 4, 14, 26. which concern the Hee-Goat, <hi>v.</hi> 8. the King of <hi>Graecia, v.</hi> 21. but thoſe in the Revelation cannot be natural days, or only three years and half, for the Beaſt is of long continuance, and hath been hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years in the work of the 42 Months, treading down the Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2. and his Wounding and Healing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. and the Earths wondring after the Beaſt, and his being ridden by Myſtical Babylon, ſo as to have all Nations Drunk with the Wine of her Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 2, 3, 4, 5. hath been hundreds of years, and the Churches Sack-cloth State very long; theſe things cannot be confined to 1260 natural days, but muſt be ſo many years.</p>
               <p>Many have been miſtaken in their Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and therefore I would not be too po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive therein, but in probability thoſe Days and Months began before <hi>Ann.</hi> 400. this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth diverſe ways.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The 42 Months and 1260 days muſt begin after the utter dethroning of the Dragon, or caſting down Pagans from their Imperial Seat and Worſhip:</hi> for upon that provocation and the triumph, the Beaſt as his Succeſſor driveth the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wilderneſs for ſuch a time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6, 13, 14. They cannot begin upon his firſT overthrow by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, but ſo as his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ce was no more found in Heaven, <hi>v.</hi> 8. and therefore not till after <hi>Julian,</hi> who was the laſt profeſſedly Pagan Emperor, and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ann.</hi> 360 or not long after, and theſe Days muſt begin after this, and not before, for the Horns were not Crowned, and in the Work
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98846:33"/>
of the Beaſt till then, yet before <hi>Ann.</hi> 400.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The 1260 Days had their beginning ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt riſing of the Ten-Horned Crowned Beaſt:</hi> For, the 42 Months are aſſigned or allotted to him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1, 5. power was given him to do 42 Months; he being of ſuch a Savage Nature, <hi>v.</hi> 2. like a Leopard, a Bear, a Lion, would take the firſt opportunity offered for being in his Work; there is no evidence that he delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the deadly Wound was made, much leſs to the time of Healing, which was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years after. His receiving his Power, and Throne, and great Authority, <hi>v.</hi> 2. (whence enſued the Worſhiping him, <hi>v.</hi> 4.) is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before the deadly Wound; but that Wound being given ſoon after his firſt riſing, that is the reaſon why ſo little of his Work is mentioned till after that; yet doubtleſs he was found in it ſoon after his firſt riſing or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ann</hi> 400.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Some ſay that the 1260 Days probably muſt ſo begin, as</hi> Daniels 1290 <hi>days may expire or end with them, and ſo begin in likelineſs before</hi> Ann. 400.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> hearing of a time of unparallelled trouble, and that then his People (the Jews) ſhould be delivered, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1. enquireth <hi>v.</hi> 6. How long ſhall it be to the end of theſe Wonders? the anſwer was, in two branches, the one by a Gentile number [of time, times, and half,] <hi>v.</hi> 7. which is the ſame with 1260 days. <hi>Daniel</hi> not underſtanding enquireth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain after the end, <hi>v.</hi> 8. and hath an anſwer again, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. in two branches; the former is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98846:34"/>
by 1290 days, which diſcovereth when the time, times, and half were to end, elſe it were no explication thereof, ſeeing they are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent times, cannot begin and end together. And whether they end with the 1260 days or not, yet he giveth a direction when thoſe 1290 days are to begin <hi>v.</hi> 11. from the time that the daily Sacrifice ſhall be taken away and the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination that maketh deſolate ſet up, ſhall be 1290 days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Now this muſt be either the Epiphanean or a Roman abomination; there is no third ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to make the <hi>Epocha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot think that the Epiphanean, <hi>i. e.</hi> When <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> prophaned the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Temple, 167. years before Chriſt, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: For the abomination of deſolation in <hi>Daniel</hi> is mentioned as to come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 15. in words agreeing not only to <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 27. but as aptly to <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11. where the time, times, and half, to be explained, clearly refer to the fourth Monarchy. And it is as rational that he ſhould look back to another Viſion, given to himſelf as to another third Monarchy from the fourth. And if we begin the 1290 days at <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> they muſt end about <hi>Ann.</hi> 1123. where was no ſuitable event for their expiration; ſome would have it to be, the firſt Revelation of Antichriſt. But it is an anſwer to <hi>Daniels</hi> queſtion which twice was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the beginning or revelation of him, but the end of thoſe Wonders, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. And beſides, the Revelation of Antichriſt was long before <hi>Ann.</hi> 1123. if not <hi>Ann.</hi> 606. yet to be ſure
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98846:34"/>
when <hi>Eerengarius</hi> and others openly witneſſed againſt him, <hi>An.</hi> 1049. Neither ſhould the 1335 Days then uſher in Bleſſedneſs, (as <hi>v.</hi> 12.) but great Perſecution.</p>
               <p>It muſt then refer to a Roman Abomination; not at <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> about <hi>An. 70. Mat.</hi> 24. 15, 16. compared with <hi>Luk</hi> 21. 20, 21. for then not only the 1290. but alſo the 1335, were expired long ago, and yet the Bleſſedneſs entailed is not come.</p>
               <p>It remaineth then, that it muſt either be from the Antichriſtian Abomination, <hi>viz.</hi> from the taking away of the true Goſpel-Sacrifice, and ſetting up the Abomination of Myſtical-<hi>Babylon,</hi> making deſolate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 19. and 19. <hi>v.</hi> 19. and this ſeemeth not to be intended; for <hi>Daniel</hi> uſing that Phraſe two or three times, never applieth it that way, nor doth he, or <hi>John,</hi> aſſign any ſuch Number as 1290 days to her, or to the Beaſt that carrieth her; yet if other accounts fail, this muſt ſtand; becauſe God is true.</p>
               <p>Or it muſt be the <hi>Julian</hi> Abomination; thoſe days cannot begin ſince upon any Jewiſh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for there hath never been any Jewiſh Temple ſince to ſacrifice in or at and to be taken away. Alſo that Stupendious Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the time of <hi>Julian,</hi> ſeemeth to many ſutable for the 1290 days (a Jewiſh, not a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Number) to begin with: For, he armed the Jews againſt the Chriſtians, demanded why they did not uſe Sacrificing, ſeeing the Law commanded it? When they anſwered, it was permitted to them only to Sacrifice in one
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98846:35"/>
place, the Temple. Then ſuddenly he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Temple to be Rebuilt, and by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Earthquake, Thunder, Lightning and Fire, the Foundation Stones of the Temple (till that day unſtirred) were thrown out of their places, and their Tools and Inſtruments burnt up, ſo as <hi>Cyril</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> then remembred the Propheſie, that there ſhould not be one Stone of the Temple le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t upon another, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. See <hi>Socrat. lib. 3. c.</hi> 17. or 20. <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> who lived in the very time of <hi>Julian, lib 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c.</hi> 1. ſaith, That certain flaming Balls of Fire iſſuing near unto the Foundations, and making many terrible Aſſaults, conſumed ſundry times the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and made the place unacceſſible. Now, to attempt to re-edify a Jewiſh Temple pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely for Jewiſh Worſhip, and Sacrificing in Goſpel Times, and that in direct Oppoſition to Chriſt and Chriſtianity, thereby to take away the true Goſpel-Sacrifice and Worſhip, was a heighth of Abomination, and ſuch as in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous way brought Deſolation: and although there be no account of any Sacrifice then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, yet it was deſigned, and the Temple then being made utterly deſolate, hence the daily Sacrifice (which depended upon the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 5, 6, 7.) muſt needs be taken away alſo. And though <hi>Julian</hi> was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally or with an Army in the holy Place or City; yet then he perfected the Deſolation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the time of <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> by his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict about the Third Year of his Reign. <hi>Am. Marcell. lib. 23. c.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:98846:35"/>And this is ſtill the more conſiderable in that the Abomination of Pagan Worſhip being ſet up about the Second Year of his Reign, the Lord made it deſolate alſo by a miraculous Earthquake or Fire; the Ethnick Temple in <hi>Delphos</hi> was overwhelmed and burnt down when <hi>Julian</hi> had ſent a Legate to offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice therein, and to conſult with the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> there, of the Event of the <hi>Perſian</hi> War. <hi>Chron Carion. l. 3. Am. Marcell. lib. 22 c</hi> 4. 12. [On the 11th. day before the Kalends of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> (i. e. 21. of <hi>October</hi>) the moſt ſtately Temple of <hi>Apollo Daphnaeus</hi> which <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> (that ireful and cruel King built) together with the Image therein of <hi>Jupiter Clympicus,</hi> equal in bigneſs to the Patron it reſembled, by ſudden Violence of Fire was burnt]. And the Abomination of Heathen and Jewiſh Worſhip being attempted to be ſet up by <hi>Julian</hi> (as another <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi>) were made a Deſolation near the ſame time, <hi>viz.</hi> between <hi>An.</hi> 360. and 366.</p>
               <p>And indeed there was a ſutable Event about the time of their Expiration, For <hi>Ann.</hi> 1650. there was a Preludium of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Salvation, (whoſe Deliverance was the thing enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>v.</hi> 1.) if <hi>Julian</hi>'s act was a little after <hi>An.</hi> 360. often God doth cut ſhort his work, and omit ſmall Numbers (as <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13.) in a great Number. And according to Mr. <hi>Brett</hi>'s Narrative by the leave of the Turk and the King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> there was <hi>Octob.</hi> 12. 1650. a Council of the Jews conſiſting of about 300, and Spectators near 3000, to enquire after the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98846:36"/>
Meſſiah, whether he were come or not? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt were he or not?</p>
               <p>After Seven or Eight days Conference, ſome of the Roman Clergy mentioning the uſe of Images and Praying to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>—they brake up in diſorder; yet it's ſaid, the Jews agreed upon another Meeting which was to be Three Years after, and in <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the 1290 days ended there, then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 45 more will make up the 1335 days, and uſher in the Bleſſedneſs of their Deliverance, let the Event determine.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The 1260 days must begin about the time when there were two Wings of the Roman Eagle, for the Woman the Church to flee by into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> Rev. 12. <hi>v.</hi> 14. i. e. when the Empire (the Enſign whereof was the Eagle) was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Eaſt—Weſt: So it was between <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> about <hi>An. 395. Helvic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. <hi>The 1260 days must begin before the Dragon poured out his Flood to drown the Woman,</hi> Rev. 12. <hi>v.</hi> 14. for this Flood was caſt out, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—[after her, or upon her Back] and therefore the was upon her Journey going into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, or gone, gotten thither, when this Flood was poured out, but the Earth ſwallowed up the Flood, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and the Dragon was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.</p>
               <p>Now many think it was a Flood of corrupt Doctrines, called Hereſies, and about <hi>An.</hi> 395. and after, theſe did ſwarm, the Eaſtern Churches were even over-run with Arianiſm yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Weſt the Barbarian perſecuting <hi>Vandals</hi> turned Arians! ſo there were <hi>Neſtorians, Pelagians,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98846:36"/>
Eutychians,</hi> &amp;c. which Earthly Men, <hi>i. e.</hi> Civil Emperours by calling Councils did in ſome meaſure dry up.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſay that this was the Flood, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the chiefeſt of theſe corrupt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, <hi>viz.</hi> Arianiſm, did prevail in the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> before the Beaſt was up, before the Womans going into the Wilderneſs, and Emperours themſelves did Countenance Arianiſm, as <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and after him <hi>Valens,</hi> who were Arians and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors.</p>
               <p>I think it was a Dragoniſh, Paganiſh Flood; for it is [out of the Mouth of the Serpent]. <hi>v.</hi> 15. and [Waters] in this Book are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 15. [People, and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, and Nations, and Tongues]. Let it then be a Flood or Multitudes of barbarous People, and that not every Inundation of them wherein they prevailed againſt the Empire; but ſome particular overflow of them (after the Beaſt was up) wherein their deſign was chiefly againſt the Woman, or Chriſtian Church, and wherein they were unſucceſsful, the Earth helping the Woman, they are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, as <hi>v.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>And where we find this, we may conclude that the Woman was now going, or gone into the Wilderneſs; and ſo the 1260 days did begin a little before.</p>
               <p>Now this Flood of Barbarians was either at the Attempt of <hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Arbogaſtes,</hi> or elſe at <hi>Rhadagaiſus,</hi> or both; which Actions I ſhall here add, and judge whether they do
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98846:37"/>
not aptly anſwer to all that is ſaid of this Flood.</p>
               <p>It muſt be remembred that about this time the Conteſt was afreſh about Pagan Worſhip, which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had thrown down; and ſaith <hi>Calviſ. An. 384. Gentiles petunt reſtitui Romae cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Ethnicum; Ambroſius reſiſtit &amp; obtinet.</hi> And <hi>An.</hi> 394. he ſaith, <hi>Eugenius cum ſuis clauſtra Alpinm contra Theodoſium munit, minitatur<expan>

                     </expan> Chriſtianae religioni exitium ſi victor rediret;</hi> the like ſay others. It is apparent then that the very deſign of <hi>Eugenius</hi> was againſt Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to reſtore Paganiſm in the Roman Empire, and having Uſurped the Supremacy in the Weſt Parts of the World, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Civil Emperour, after ſpending the Night in Prayer to God, waged War with him, and though the Enemy were ſo many that it ſeemed impoſſible to encounter them, yet there aroſe ſo violent a Wind and Tempeſt, as the like never had been ſeen by any Man then living, which without annoyance to the Emperour's People, did turn the Darts of. <hi>Eugenius</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to light in their own ſide, that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> obtained a compleat Victory. See <hi>Socrat. Oroſ. Funccius.</hi>—</p>
               <p>And thus this Dragon Flood caſt out pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to drown the Woman, the Church, was ſwallowed up, not by Eccleſiaſtical Councils, but (through Divine Concurrence) by the Earthly, Civil or Military Power of <hi>Theodoſius.</hi>

               <p>6. <hi>The 1260 days muſt begin upon a Perſecution raiſed by the revengeful overthrown Dragon in the form of a Beaſt, by which the Woman (the Church) was driven into a VVilderneſs Condition:</hi> This [<hi>Perſecution</hi>] thus limited I take to be the cleareſt, firmeſt and moſt Signal Character of all, for the diſcovering when the 1260 days and 42 Months muſt begin, and yet not inſiſted on by Writers, I ſuppoſe from their Miſtake thinking the firſt Beaſt to be the Pope, and ſo making an Apoſtacy of his to be the <hi>Epocha;</hi> whereas he is the ſecond Beaſt, and there is another firſt Beaſt which thoſe 42 Months and Prophetical Days are to begin with; and that at a Perſecution, as all the Three Chapters where thoſe Days and Months are mentioned, do clearly evidence; as, <hi>Rev. 11. v.</hi> 2, 3. the holy City ſhall they (<hi>i. e</hi> the Gentiles) tread under foot 42 Months. That [treading down] importeth Subjection, great Sufferings by Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies inſulting over them with contempt; and alſo the Witneſſes being in Sack-cloth ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the like.</p>

It is an alluſion to the flight of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from an enraged Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, perſecuting <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> with ſuch a flight (which importeth Tribulation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 20, 21.) do the 1260 days begin, and therefore with Perſecution; and expreſly, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14.

               <p>The third place is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 5. Power was given him <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And note, it is not every Perſecution that doth make the Epocha: it is not any till Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, <hi>i. e.</hi> Pagan headſhip was caſt down, and ſo not any of the Ten Perſecutions, not any till after <hi>Julian;</hi> but after the firſt Beaſt with crowned Horns was up, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. which was many Years before the ſixth Head of Emperours went down.

[he] <hi>i. e.</hi> the Dragon [when he ſaw he was caſt unto the earth, he perſecuted the Woman—]. It was then a freſh Perſecution, upon that Provocation, his caſting down.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98846:38"/>
as driveth the Woman into a Wilderneſs-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 13, 14. which noteth not a change of Place, ſo much as of State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anſwerable to that of the Iſraelites in the Wilderneſs. It mporteth a ſolitary, afflicted, yet ſafe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; full of Wants, Dangers, Trials, Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet having Divine Protections, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Preſervations.</p>
               <p>And hence, none need be ſtumbled at the ſeeming or real Godlineſs, either of ſome Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, (or Popes) after the Beaſt was up; For, if the Head of Emperours did not perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, yet if ſome of the Crowned Horns did, though others did not; yet, it may be deemed a Perſecution of the Beaſt. Often an action of a part is reckoned to the whole, as <hi>Achan</hi>'s to <hi>Iſrael, Joſh.</hi> 7. 1, 11. So 1 <hi>King. 14. 22. Am. 2. 5. Rev.</hi> 17. 16. compared with <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 9. So whether Head or Horns, ſome of them perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Church into the Wilderneſs, and this giveth the firſt Date to the 1260 days. The great Queſtion then here, is,</p>
               <p>When did that Perſecution begin by the Dragon in form of a Beaſt, with Crowned Horns, out of revenge for his Overthrow, whereby the Church was driven into a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs-Condition?

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of what Enſueth after the 1260 Days are at an End.</head>
               <p>IT is confidently concluded by many Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that exactly and immediately after the Perioding of the 42 Months and 1260 Days, there is an end of the Dominion
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98846:41"/>
of the Beaſt, and of the Sufferings of the Saints; whereas I am confident they are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in both; another Event was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. It's true, then the Witneſſes come out of their Sackcloth-ſtate, but ſoon after they paſs into a worſe ſtate; as will appear under the next Rule.</p>
               <p>Rule 8. <hi>That after the Expiration of the 1260 Days, and finiſhing of the Teſtimony, there is a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs-killing War, the Death and Reſurrection of the Witneſſes, and a great Commotion before the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Seventh Trumpet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This appeareth: For,</p>
               <p>It's clear that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s little Horn continueth after the time, times and half, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 25, 26. the Judgment ſhall ſit, and they ſhall take away his Dominion, to conſume and deſtroy it to the End.</p>
               <p>Therefore his loſing his Dominion and his Deſtruction, will be by a Conſumption after thoſe times (which are the ſame with 1260 Days) are ended. Yea, he is prevalent, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to change Times and Laws; How long? <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. until the ancient of days came,—and the Saints poſſeſſed the Kingdom, <hi>i. e.</hi> until the Seventh Trumpet.</p>
               <p>And further to confirm this, after the time, times and half, it is added, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 7. [and when he ſhall have accompliſhed to ſcatter the Power of the holy People, all theſe things ſhall be finiſhed] <hi>viz. Daniel</hi>'s People, the Jews, ſhall be delivered, <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:98846:42"/>So then, the accompliſhing to ſcatter the Power of the holy People, is after the time, times and half are expired. And ſeeing we read not of any new ſcattering of the Jews, and this belongeth to the Fourth Monarchy, and is a Gentile Number, it may poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to Gentile Chriſtians, and be in part ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of the way of ſlaying the Witneſſes by a ſcattering them and their Church-Aſſemblies, after theſe times or 1260 days are expired.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>John</hi> in the Revelation clearly placeth what concerneth the Death of the Witneſſes after the 1260 days are ended, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when they have finiſhed their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,—then, and not before, doth the Witneſs-killing War begin. I had rather ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſo in the time paſt, being in the <hi>Aorist</hi> than [when they are about to finiſh]. And their Teſtimony was not finiſhed till the 1260 days of their Propheſying expired; ſeeing the Teſtimony of Jeſus is the Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10.) ſo long as they Propheſie, (though in Sackcloth) it is not finiſhed either for time or work. And not only the import of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but the Nature of the thing maketh that War and Death ſubſequent. For during the 1260 days of their propheſying the Witneſſes are Overcomers, and their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are killed. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 5, 6. [if any Man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their Mouth, and devoureth their Enemies]—and [he muſt in this manner be killed]—and this [in the days of their Propheſie]—</p>
               <p>Whereas the iſſue of this War is, the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98846:42"/>
are overcome and killed, <hi>v.</hi> 7. the Beaſt—ſhall overcome and kill them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7.</p>
               <p>Yea, the Propheſying ſtate, in the very mentioning of it, is inconſiſtent with the Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and the Death far worſe than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying, though in Sackcloth; ſo long as they Propheſie they are alive, not dead. Neither do the Witneſſes in the time of their lying dead, torment the Earth-dwellers, as they do in the time of their Propheſying, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 10.</p>
               <p>The Concluſion then is, that the finiſhing of the Teſtimony, however the Witneſs-killing War, and the Death of the Witneſſes are after the 42 Months and 1260 days are expired and at an end.</p>
               <p>For the further diſcovering who are the Witneſſes, and what their Death; how, where, and when they are to be Slain, taken Seven Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Prop. I. <hi>That the [Two Witneſſes] are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters, and pure Profeſſors or Beaſt-oppoſing Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For they are [two Candleſticks] <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 4. (which are interpreted Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſeven Candleſticks are ſeven Churches), and they are [two Olive Trees] which is but an Alluſion to <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 3, 11, 14. and cannot be confined to Magiſtrates and Miniſters, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are never called a Candleſtick, and pure Profeſſors and Churches are anointed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98846:43"/>
ones, <hi>Rom. 11. 17, 18, 19, 20. 1 John 2. 20. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 9. Yea, theſe are ſuch as Prophecy (1 <hi>Cor. 14. 24, 31. Rev.</hi> 19. 10.) and that 1260 <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 3. not only making a Profeſſion at large, but bearing and finiſhing a Teſtimony for Chriſt and his Kingdom againſt the Beaſt, as <hi>v.</hi> 7. ſo as he becometh their Enemy, and maketh War with them. The Two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are their Teſtimony, and ſo cannot be the Witneſſes; however it cometh to the ſame in Effect; for if theſe, or Magiſtrates and Miniſters lye dead, then ſo will ſuch pure Profeſſors and Churches alſo, and ſo are to be deemed Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Prop. II. <hi>That [the Death of the Witneſſes] is an Extremity of Suffering: Or, it conſiſteth in an unparallell'd Ceſſation of Testimony and Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Means and Comforts of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The various Phraſes of overcoming and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, may intimate its being attended with much Bloodſhed: but it is not chiefly a corporal Death, for then ſuch muſt be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection or recovery out of it, and that under the ſixth Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11 11. 14. whereas the corporal reſurrection is not until the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>v.</hi> 18. And their Enemies behold them with pleaſure three Prophetical days or years and half, which they could not do if it were a corporal Death. It muſt then be a metaphorical Death, by the Churches being in a ſtate and condition full of Extremity, of Affliction and Suffering, which often is called
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98846:43"/>
a Death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. and 11. <hi>v. 23. Pſal.</hi> 71. 20. and 80. 18. <hi>Iſai. 26. 19. Ezek. 37. 10.—35. Rom.</hi> 11. 15. It will not only be a civil death, by deprivation of Publick Miniſtration and Employment, as to the exerciſe of office; but alſo a ſpiritual Death, by an unparallelled Ceſſation of Teſtimony, for they dye not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Men, but as Witneſſes they loſe much of their witneſſing Spirit, <hi>Rev</hi> 11. 7. Their ſtate is far worſe than in their propheſying time, poſſibly by military Men having Power over, (<hi>v.</hi> 9, 10.) and forcibly diſabling of them for former actual witneſſing work; and thus it will be not only their Sin, but their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there is a failing of their Teſtimony. And although Spiritual Life it ſelf will not utterly fail, yet they will in an extraordinary unpreſidented way, be cut ſhort of external means for the ſupport of it, ſo as they are deemed as dead Corps, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration or recovery, is by the Spirit of Life from God entring into them, which importeth a precedent want of it. As the dead-ſtate of the Jews or Iſraelites, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. importeth not only the ruin of their City, deſtruction of their Temple, deſpoiling of them of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Comforts, Houſes, Lands, Relations. Accommodations;—but the Profaning of the ſolemn Worſhip of God, the trampling under foot his Ordinances, the caſting down from Church-ſtate or work, and ſubjecting them to the wills of mercileſs Men, and their own drawing up deſpairing Concluſions, <hi>v.</hi> 11. our hope is loſt, we are cut off for our parts:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98846:44"/>
and the reſtoring of them, is a recovery out of this condition, <hi>v.</hi> 8. to 15.</p>
               <p>So the Death of the Witneſſes importeth the like; an unparallelled, unwonted loſs of a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing Spirit, deprivation of the external Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Ordinances of Chriſt and Church-ſtate, by ſcattering, loſs of Communion, and all ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated with the triumphant Blaſphemies of Enemies, and Inſultations over them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 10. and their own deſpairing Concluſions, from their ſeeing no viſible poſſibility of coming into a better condition afterward; all which, will be attended with a variety of other Afflictions and Sufferings, rendring their conditions ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable, as is hardly to be pre-conceived of before experienced.</p>
               <p>Prop. III. <hi>That it is by a latter Victorious War of the First Beast that the Witneſſes are ſlain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7.—The Beaſt that aſcendeth out of the bottomleſs Pit, ſhall make War againſt them, and ſhall overcome and kill them.</p>
               <p>Where note, It was not by [the Dragon] <hi>i. e.</hi> not by any of the Ten Perſecutions in the Firſt three hundred Years after Chriſt, under Pagan Emperours, but by [the Beaſt] who was the Dragon's Succeſſor; he is the ſlayer of the Witneſſes: and not the ſecond Beaſt, the Pope (though it may be by his Inſtigation) but by the firſt Civil, Perſecuting, Ten-horned, Crowned, Whore-ridden Beaſt: for, it is by him which aſcendeth out of the bottomleſs Pit; Compare
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98846:44"/>
                  <hi>Rev. 17. v.</hi> 3, 7, 8. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1, 2. and 11. 7.</p>
               <p>And it is by [a War] not a meer worldly literal War, but a Spiritual, Myſtical War, by a difference ſtated between the Witneſſes and the Beſtians; and ſo, not where the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Beaſt hath wholly prevailed, but where Chriſt hath a potent party to make op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. And, not any War ſoon after the riſing of the Ten-Horned Beaſt, or during the 1260 days, but when the Witneſſes have finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their teſtimony as to time and work, and are overcome and the War ended; and hence this [Death of the Witneſſes] was not by any National diſtreſſes and calamities, which equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betide Beſtians and the true Witneſſes; nor could the Death of the Witneſſes be before or at the <hi>Smalcaldian</hi> War, nor at the Council of <hi>Trent, Ann.</hi> 1546. nor at the Maſſacre at <hi>Paris, Ann.</hi> 1572. for from the riſing of the Horns to thoſe times, the 1260 days could not be ended, or teſtimony finiſhed, and ſo the Witneſs-killing War was not then ſo much as begun.</p>
               <p>Prop. IV. <hi>That it is in an open place of Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Babylon that the Witneſſes lie dead:</hi> How long this Witneſs-killing War laſteth, the Scripture doth not determine, but the event muſt, but it leaveth Spiritleſs, Lifeleſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 8. their dead bodies ſhall lye in the Street of the great City, which Spiritually is called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where alſo our Lord was Crucified.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:98846:45"/>This [great City] is Myſtical Babylon, ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 8. and 16. <hi>v.</hi> 19. and 17. <hi>v.</hi> 18. and 18. <hi>v.</hi> 10, 16, 18, 19, 21. and the deſcription agreeth to that, for it is [Spiritually] <hi>i. e.</hi> not literally, but myſtically called [<hi>Sodom</hi>] for ſpiritual Whoredom and Idolatry, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 5.) and [<hi>Egypt</hi>] for tyranny and cruelty (<hi>Rev</hi> 17. 6.) [where our Lord was Crucified] which was under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> a Roman Deputy, and in that Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>It cannot be literally [<hi>Jeruſalem</hi>] for that was not a great City in the days of <hi>John,</hi> nor ever after till the New <hi>Jeruſalem, (Rev.</hi> 21. 10.) after which there will be no more ſorrow or death <hi>(v. 4.)

And ſo, either they are ſlain in diverſe Nations and Kingdoms, or elſe after dead, they are tranſported, exiled, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by flight diſperſed and driven for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge thither, and finding welcome there, by their kindneſs are ſheltred, and ſecured from burial, from utter ruin and deſtruction. Or elſe (as ſome think) military men of all gatherings of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations, Kindreds and Tongues, will have power over them, and hold them under their death; and the Beſtians are expreſſed under the ſame notions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7, 8. and the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwellers rejoice over them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 10 and to be ſure theſe are Enemies.</p>
               <p>Prop. 5. <hi>That when the Witneſſes have lain dead three years and half, they ſhall be eminently revived and advanced,</hi> Rev. 11. 11, 12. After three days and half, the Spirit of life from God entred into them—and they heard a voice
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98846:46"/>
from Heaven, ſaying unto them, Come up hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—It is a determinate time, elſe it might have been ſaid as well after three or four days, if only a ſhort uncertain time had been intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whereas it is three days and half, and ſo twice mentioned. Nor can they be Natural days, for the Earth-dwellers could not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate one another at a diſtance, in three natural days and half. Nor are they the ſame with the 1260 days; For, who can imagine that ſo many days ſhould ſignifie no more than three days and half in the ſame breath? And beſides, they are different ſtates, the one of Sackcloth the other of Death. Neither are they dead when they begin their teſtimony (as that would have it) nor till they finiſh it. It remaineth then that the time of the Witneſſes lying dead is [three years and half] not to be counted from the firſt beginning of trouble, that is longer, for the witneſs-killing War bringeth trouble, but from the end of the War, when it can be ſaid, Now the Witneſſes are overcome and killed, are able to make no more conſiderable oppoſition againſt the Beſtians, but are Spiritleſs, their power is gone; thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin thoſe days.</p>
               <p>And hence, where the Witneſſes remain in the ſame deplorable and ſad condition, or go into a worſe, a longer ſpace, as four or ſix years, that is not the time of the Witneſſes lying dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For it is ſaid [After three days and half, the Spirit of life from God entred into them] <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 11.

               <p>[And they ſtood upon their feet] they were fallen down, but now are recovered into a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poſture, to the affrightment, and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Spectators; [Great fear fell upon them which ſaw them.] This ſecond ſtep followeth not long after their reviving, a reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Afterwards they have an invitation or call into a more honourable condition, <hi>v.</hi> 12. [and they heard a great voice from Heaven, ſaying, Come up hither.] It is not the higheſt Heaven, for the call thither is not till the end of the Seventh Trumpet; but [the Church] is [the Heaven] they are called up to, which they were greatly caſt down from, during the time of their Death, now they are called to publick exerciſes again, in a Church State of exaltation and advancement, [and they aſcended] their Reſurrection is immediately after the half day, but their Aſcention may be ſome time after, more gradual, and [in a Cloud] <hi>i. e.</hi> with a great multitude, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. a Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; a vaſt number, who at their death ſeemed fewer: what if this Cloud ſhould be that fulneſs of the Gentiles coming in, as an immediate fore-runner of the Jews return, and <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> being ſaved? <hi>Rom. 11. v.</hi> 25, 26. [and their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies beheld them] <hi>Rev. 11. v.</hi> 11. 12. this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at the ſecond view differeing ſo much from the firſt, <hi>v.</hi> 11. maketh me queſtion, whether the great fear after the reſurrection of the Witneſſes when they ſtand upon their feet be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98846:47"/>
not of friends as Enemies, anſwerable to that great fear at the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, (all alluding to him) which fell upon thoſe that kept the Watch to hinder his riſing, as well as upon thoſe Diſciples that ſought him after riſen, <hi>Matth. 28. v. 2, 3, 4, 8. Mark 16. v.</hi> 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>So after the Reſurrection of the Witneſſes at firſt hand, not only thoſe that have kept the Watch, and by Edicts and Acts, in the time of their Death ſought to hinder their riſing, are ſtruck into a pannick fear, but as well many Friends and Witneſſes may be filled with great trembling, fear and amazement, at the firſt hand, by the Earth-quake and terrible diſpenſations. The riſing of the Witneſſes at firſt, may not be obvious to eminent Chriſtians, ſo as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from fear, or great workings of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief: but at their Aſcention, their exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by that call is ſo eminent and publick, that then [the Enemies] of the Witneſſes only fall under aſtoniſhing fears.</p>
               <p>And obſerve, that whilſt the Witneſſes lie dead, there is a remnant that is ſecured from that death; all the Witneſſes in all places do not die, it is not ſo general; God hath a reſerve in that day, of a number that ſhall bear ſome teſtimony, and not ſuffer at the rate that others do, where the ſtage of this Tragedy is, in the time of lying dead; For thoſe that lay dead (all of them for ought I know) are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up into Heaven, into a ſtate of exaltation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 12. and therefore there are others who give the call, and not thoſe that lay
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98846:47"/>
dead; theſe do not call themſelves but are called, therefore there are others who did not fall under that Death: but theſe Witneſſes or Friends who are reſerved, ſhall not appear ſo eminently till about the time of their Aſcenſion, then the Witneſſes had that call, [and they Aſcended up to Heaven in a Cloud.]</p>
               <p>Prop. 6. <hi>That there is an Earth-quake or ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious alterations, to the deſolating a famous tenth part of the City, about the time of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes reſtoration:</hi> Rev. 11. 13. [and the ſame hour (or day, as in ſome copies) there was a great Earth-quake—] <hi>i. e.</hi> at the ſame time with the Witneſſes Reſurrection; poſſibly as a means of their riſing, it alludeth to <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 1, 2. or at their Aſcenſion.</p>
               <p>There was [an Earth quake] <hi>i. e.</hi> commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or wonderful alterations in the face of things, (as <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 12.) and would hardly be called [a great Earth-quake] if it did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to many Nations and Kingdoms. This ſeemeth to be a Turkiſh Earth-quake, for it is cloſed thus, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 14. The ſecond Woe is paſt—<hi>i. e.</hi> the Sixth Trumpet is over, which ſounded by the Turk, as is generally granted and proved, in that all matters of it aptly agree to him. So that this is a ſure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to tell us where we are at the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Aſcenſion, <hi>viz.</hi> at the concluſion of the Sixth Trumpet.</p>

                  </hi> 10, &amp; 11. and then addeth, <hi>v.</hi> 14. The ſecond Woe is paſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Witneſſes being Riſen, Aſcended, and the Earth-quake over, now the Turks have done their work of the ſixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, the puniſhing the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> for their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Worſhiping Images of Gold and Silver, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 20, 21.) now the Turks will ceaſe to be a Woe as formerly to them; no more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous exploits of theirs againſt Papiſts are to be expected. The Turks then may loſe their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or much of it, though their utter ruine and deſtruction may not be till afterwards, and that upon the Mountains of <hi>Iſrael, (Ezek.</hi> 39. 4.) but they will be much concerned in this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, as the laſt part of their work againſt the Romaniſts.</p>
               <p>Now this Earth-quake is ſignalized, by the deſtruction of a vaſt number of Dignitaries, either of the Turks or Romaniſts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 14. and in the Earth-quake were ſlain of men 7000. names of men, <hi>i. e.</hi> men of Name and Office (many more than of Enemies of the common ſort) poſſibly parallel to <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 6, 8, 15, 16. and by the Repentance of ſome, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 14.

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:98846:51"/>Prop. VII. <hi>That the Death of the Witneſſes,</hi> Ann. 1680. <hi>was not paſt, but to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are various thoughts among learned Men, whether this black and diſmal day of the Witneſſes Death be paſt or yet to come? I think it is near approaching, not only becauſe the days of their Sackcloth in all probability are finiſhed, and the Warring time ſeemeth near at an end; but becauſe the ſixth Trumpet hath ſounded a long time, above 200 years, if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan when the Turk obtained <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> Ann 1453. therefore the concluſion of it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be far off.</p>
               <p>I do not think the Church to be the proper ſubject, which the Trumpets ſound judgment againſt, but the Civil State of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and clearly the ſeventh bloweth good to the Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. I ſhall refer the Reader to Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and others, to ſee how and when the ſeveral Trumpets ſounded. All things concerning the ſixth agree to the Turk; and if [the hour, day, month and year] <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 15. notifie the time allotted to the Turkiſh Tyranny, then the end of his work is haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for the time muſt be counted, not from the time of their being [prepared,] but of their being [looſed] to do the work of ſlaying the third part of Men, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. This looſing of four Angels, or Sultans, ſeemeth to be before <hi>Ann.</hi> 1300. for then they fell into one <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family; however, (taking a day for a year as elfewhere) the time for that Woe will expire
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98846:51"/>
within a few years, which is after the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Reſurrection and Aſcenſion.</p>
               <p>But my opinion is, that the Death of the Witneſſes is yet to come 1680 I ſhould be glad herein to be miſtaken; my grounds are theſe.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the 1260 days, and the Warring State be at an end, their death-ſtate is not come:</hi> for it is after finiſhing their Teſtimony, that the Beaſt maketh War with them and killeth them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. So long as their Teſtimony is not finiſhed, and the War not ended, ſo long they are not Dead, nor the three days and half begun; And therefore <hi>Ann.</hi> 1680. their Death was yet to come.</p>
               <p>It's true, in the time of their Death there may be Edicts or Acts (as after the Death of Chriſt, Sealing the Tomb—) to hinder the Witneſſes Reſurrection, but till there be a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of their Teſtimony, they are not dead.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>The Condition of the Witneſſes ſince finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their teſtimony, hath not been for three years and half, far worſe than it was before, by a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſuppreſſion of Teſtimony, and other unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled ſufferings;</hi> therefore <hi>Ann.</hi> 1680. their Death was not paſt, but to come.</p>
               <p>The conſequence is clear, becauſe the Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is far worſe than the Sack-cloth-ſtate, as death is far worſe than life, though in a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condition; this hath been proved before. <hi>Prop.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Whatever the Death of the Witneſſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in, ſome recovery out of that is the immediate iſſue of the three days and half;</hi> For, elſe they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98846:52"/>
muſt be longer dead, whereas <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 11. [after three days and half, the Spirit of life from God entred into them, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>] This [life] ſtandeth in oppoſition to the [Death] and no <hi>medium</hi> between them; no moment wherein they are not either dead or alive; at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of theſe days, before the fourth day, they live. If their Death conſiſteth in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd ceſſation of Teſtimony, then there is ſome recovering into witneſſing work again, before four years be expired, and ſo whatever elſe their Death may be placed in.</p>
               <p>But no ſuch recovery out of that which is their Death, or no removal of that wherein it doth conſiſt, hath been the immediate iſſue of three years and half, of any ſuppoſed time for their death already paſt, and ſo that is yet to come.</p>
               <p>I ſee no Scripture evidence for a gradual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving or reſurrection, yet there may be a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Aſcenſion.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>There hath not been ſuch a triumphant ſtate of Earth-dwellers, for freedom from former Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they felt by the Witneſſes Propheſying, as anſwereth Rev.</hi> 11. 10. They that dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth ſhall rejoice over them, and make merry, and ſhall ſend gifts one to another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe two Prophets tormented them—It was by their Propheſying and Praying as <hi>Elias</hi> did, that they tormented the Beſtians, Carnal, Earthly minded Men; and whilſt the Witneſſes lye dead, the Earth-dwellers are in a very proſperous flouriſhing condition, keep a Jubilee, with more than ordinary ſigns of joy,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98846:52"/>
(as the variety of Expreſſions intimates) and this for freedom from their former Torments.</p>
               <p>But no ſuch triumphant State of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwellers hath been experienced in the time paſt, ſince finiſhing their Teſtimony. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Death is yet to come.</p>
               <p>The like might be ſaid of the Nations, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and Tongues not ſeeing their dead Bodies, ſo as to hinder their Burial, <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Immediately after the reviving of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes from their Death-ſtate, there is ſuch a reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to their former Poſture, as is to the great affrightment of Spectators,</hi> Rev. 11. 11, 12.—Great fear fell upon them which ſaw them.</p>
               <p>But this is not yet experienced by Friends or Enemies, and ſo their Death-ſtate is not paſt, but yet to come.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>There hath not been</hi> Ann. 1680. <hi>ſuch a great Earthquake or Commotion as uſhers in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of the Witneſſes reſurrection.</hi> And ſo it is not paſt, but yet to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 13. The ſame Hour there was a great Earthquake—</p>
               <p>There is not yet a fall of that famous Tenth part of the City, nor the Slaughter of 7000. a vaſt number of Men of Name; nor the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of a Remnant, ſo as to give Glory to God; nor is the Turkiſh Wo yet paſt, as <hi>v.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcention of the Witneſſes cannot be yet paſt, but to come.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>The ſeventh Trumpet hath not yet ſounded; Therefore the Witneſſes are not yet aſcended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:98846:53"/>For then that cometh quickly, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 14, 15. though not the ſame moment with their Reſurrection, yet very ſpeedily after their Aſcenſion, and ſo their Death could not be at the time many fix upon; as at the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>—which are paſt above 100 years paſt.</p>
               <p>It's true, the great Reformation about the time of <hi>Luther,</hi> hath its place in the words of this Book, ſo as one of the ſeven Vials (I think the fourth Vial) was then eminently poured out; but that was not the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet.</p>
               <p>There are invincible Arguments to prove, that the ſeventh Trumpet hath not yet ſounded.</p>
               <p>For, when that doth begin to ſound, the Myſtery of God is finiſhed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10 7. as he hath declared to his Servants the Prophets. And what can this be, or is called ſo in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it can be applied to, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Jews? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25, 26 And it is evident, the Jews are not yet converted and ſaved.</p>
               <p>And further, the ſecond Turkiſh Wo is not yet paſt; they do not yet ceaſe to be a Wo to the Roman Idolaters, which muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>And there is a Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of the Witneſſes before the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 11, 12, 15. after which, it can never be proved that they ſhall paſs under a Death any more, or ſuch an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Suffering as they are under at this day, in <hi>France</hi> and elſewhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:98846:53"/>And once more, immediately after the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, not only a Jewiſh Nation, but the Kingdoms of this World become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. and that ſo, as he reigneth for ever and ever. And therefore after the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet Antichriſt ſhall never recover, to regain any of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to ſubmit to him again, as he hath done ſince the Reformation. Therefore the ſeventh Trumpet hath not yet ſounded; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Witneſſes are not yet aſcended.</p>
               <p>I have wondred that this ſeventh Trumpet beginneth thus, and not with terrible Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations; but poſſibly the aforementioned great Earthquake, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 13. did much of the firſt deſtructive work, ſo as to uſher in this triumph, <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, 17. and ſo the firſt ſounding of it is with Praiſes, and much of the Wo of the Trumpet is reſerved to the latter part of it, <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19.</p>

               <p>AS the ſeven Seals were ſeveral degrees of Judgment upon <hi>Rome</hi> Dragon or Pagan; and the ſeven Trumpets ſounded an Alarm of Judgment upon the Civil State of the Empire; ſo the ſeven Vials are ſeveral degrees of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment coming upon it after its Papal State;

and alſo upon other Enemies of Jeſus Chriſt at laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 14 relateth to the time of the Vials; For there is the Song of the Lamb, <hi>v.</hi> 1. which anſwereth <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 1.</p>
               <p>It referreth to a time of viſible Separation from Antichriſtian Pollutions and Victory over the Beaſt and his mark, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1, 4, 9. So the Vials, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 6.</p>
               <p>It relateth to the time of witneſſing againſt, and crying down <hi>Babylon, Rev. 14. 8, 9, 10. Babylon</hi> is fallen, if any Man worſhip the Beaſt—he ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God: and it is under the Vials that there is this Victory over the Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>It concerneth a time wherein an Angel hath Power over fire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 8. and this is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the fourth Vial, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 8.</p>
               <p>And it mentioneth a Harveſt and Vintage, <hi>Rev. 14. v.</hi> 15. to the end; which muſt relate to the latter Vials, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 19. and 19. <hi>v.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>And ſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. declareth the work of the Angels, or how they pour out the Vials, as well as the Condition of the Church under them.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. I take it to be no Propheſie of what ſhall be accompliſhed before the Vials begin to be poured out; but it giveth a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium or general view of Matters relating to the Vials, from the beginning to the end; like the Contents of a Chapter ſet before it; and it diſcovereth the State and Condition of the Church and People of God during the time of the Vials in a general way. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98846:54"/>
a Deſcription of the Virgin Saints, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5. by their Conqueſt over the Beaſt, and triumphant Song for that Victory, and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Privilege; [The Temple of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Teſtimony in Heaven was opened] <hi>v. 5. i. e.</hi> not before, but after Vial Judgments, <hi>v.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>And the Vial Angels more particularly are deſcribed, <hi>v.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8. by their place from which they come; not out of the World, but the Church, [out of the Temple] <hi>v.</hi> 6. by their Qualifications, [clothed in pure and white Linnen] by the Inſtruments given them, <hi>v.</hi> 7. [golden Vials] by the Perſons from whom they receive theſe Vials, <hi>v.</hi> 7. by a token of a Divine Preſence during the Vials, <hi>v.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Some think that none of the Vials are yet poured out, others are otherwiſe minded; for clearing this Matter, take a Rule or two.</p>
               <p>Rule 9. <hi>That the ſeventh Trumpet doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all the ſeven Vials.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some ſay, that none of the Vials are poured out, till the Reſurrection of the Witneſſes is paſt, and that all the Vials are under the ſeventh Trumpet.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, I am perſwaded that moſt of the Vials are poured out before the Witneſſes Reſurrection, and that only the latter part of the ſixth and the ſeventh Vial do fall under the ſeventh Trumpet; and that upon theſe Grounds.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Conſummation of the Myſtery of God
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98846:55"/>
(the Jews Converſion) is at the beginning of the ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> Rev. 10. 7. Rom. 11. 25, 26. Rev. 11. 15. Therefore before the beginning of the ſeventh Trumpet moſt of the Vials muſt be poured out; for the Converſion of the Jews is not till latter Vials, as the ſixth. And indeed by Vials the Kingdoms of the World muſt be brought off from the Beaſt, elſe they cannot become the Lords and his Chriſts.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>There have been Storms of Wrath upon, and remarkable decays of the Papal Kingdom, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Vials (as will be proved in the next Rule)</hi> Therefore ſome Vials are poured out; whereas the Witneſſes are not yet aſcended, and the ſeventh Trumpet hath not yet ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>All the wrath of the ſeventh Trumpet is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſixth or ſeventh Vial,</hi> Rev. 11. 18, 19. The anger of the Nations, Lightnings, Voices, Thundrings, Earthquake, great Hail—All are found under the ſixth or ſeventh Vials, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 12, 14, 16, to the end.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>There is no Scripture-Evidence that all the Vials muſt come under the ſeventh Trumpet; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, the Suppoſition is groundleſs,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The contrary ſeemeth to be aſſerted; for, before the Witneſſes Death or ſeventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, they have Power to turn Waters into Blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 6. which is the work of the ſecond and third Vials, and to ſmite the Earth with all Plagues, which reacheth other Vial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work.</p>
               <p>It's true, The ſeventh Seal delivereth itſelf
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98846:55"/>
into ſeven Trumpets, as its work, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 6. But ſo doth not the ſeventh Trumpet deliver it ſelf into ſeven Vials, that hath much other work of its own; and Men muſt not coyn ſuch a Method there, without a Divine Warrant.</p>
               <p>The Vial-Angels fine and white Linnen, ſpeaketh their Purity and Freedom from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian pollution, and their having the Righteouſneſs of the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 8. but this is no way unſutable to the Witneſſes in their Sackcloth-ſtate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4. Their having Harps in their hands, and rejoycing under the Vials, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 2, 3, 4. is not inconſiſtent with the Witneſſes Sackcloth-ſtate, for they may have ſometimes and cauſe of rejoycing there, <hi>Philip. 4. 4. Hab. 3. 17, 18. Rev.</hi> 16. 4, 5, 6. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the higheſt rejoycing is reſerved to the latter Vials. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 1. to 8. and 11. 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>That the ſeven Vials are the ſeven laſt Plagues, is no Proof that all of them muſt come under the ſeventh Trumpet; that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renceth them from the ſeven Seals and ſeven Trumpets, there were no more Seven diſtinct Diſpenſations to ſucceed or come after; and indeed the ſeventh Seal was opened, and divers Trumpets had ſounded before the firſt Vial was poured out, and ſo they may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the ſeven laſt Plagues, though only the wrath of the ſeventh Vial ſhould come under the ſeventh Trumpet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. Then there are Two Wo's in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wo; one by the Vials, the other by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:98846:56"/>
Angels; and the Subject of the ſecond Wo, and of the Vials differ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. No abſurdity, if there be two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Diſpenſations of Wrath in the time of one Wo; <hi>viz.</hi> Vial-wrath, and Trumpet-wrath: as it's undeniable, under the ſixth Trumpet there is great Wrath, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 15. to the end; and yet alſo another great Earthquake, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 13. Yea, it muſt be ſo, if all the Vials came under the ſeventh Trumpet; for then there would be there, the Wo of that Trumpet, and alſo of all thoſe Vials.</p>
               <p>2. They may contemporate, and yet the Subjects of the ſecond Wo and of the Vials differ; what ſhould hinder this? a Trumpet may blow Wrath to the Roman Civil Empire, and yet at the ſame time, Vials may pour out Wrath upon the Roman Papal State.</p>
               <p>But the grand Objection is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. The ſeven Vial Angels come not out of the Temple till it be opened, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 5, 6. but the Temple is not opened till the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 19. and ſo on Vials poured out till then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As to <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. It is an Epitome or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral View of Vial-Matters; as, of all the ſeven Angels coming out, <hi>v.</hi> 6. which they never did together, but at ſeveral ſeaſons; and Mr. <hi>M.</hi> obſerveth, That the Complutens Edition readeth not, come out of the Temple, but out of Heaven. Some think, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. ſpeaketh only of an opening of the Temple [of the Tabernacle] <hi>v.</hi> 5. noting an unſetled condition, or mixture of Tabernacle and Temple, ſutable
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98846:56"/>
to the former Vials, before the Sackcloth-ſtate was ended, anſwerable to which, the Song is mixed of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (whilſt yet in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 1, 2.) and of the Lamb, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and that it doth not refer to the opening under the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 19. [of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple] which concerneth a New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate of Settlement; and ſo it's far from proving that all the Vials come under the ſeventh Trumpet. My Anſwer is,</p>
               <p>1. The ſeven Angels come out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, before that opening of it under the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 19. that opening is not to let Vial Angels out, but to let a vaſt number in, and to give the higheſt and moſt glorious Diſcoveries of Jeſus Chriſt and his Matters, and not till the ſeventh Vial, [The Temple of God was opened in Heaven] and what was the Effect of it? [There was ſeen in this Temple the Ark of his Teſtament] which was a moſt eminent Symbol of his Preſence. This open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was to give the choiceſt Manifeſtations of his Preſence; it noteth the unlooſing or open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt hidden and Glorious Myſteries of all, even Chriſt himſelf. It cannot be proved that this opening is before any Angels going forth to pour out Vials; but rather after the ſeventh Vial was pouring out.</p>
               <p>Then there cometh a great Voice out of the Temple of Heaven, [from the Throne] ſaying, [It is done], <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 17. And this is, when the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> cometh down from Heaven, for there the like Phraſe is uſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 5, 6. [It is done] and, <hi>v.</hi> 25. the Gates of it ſhall
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98846:57"/>
not be ſhut at all.—Here is an opening at the ſeventh Vial; the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtandeth open, in oppoſition to ſome ſhutting in the time of former Vials. Then the Lord maketh higheſt diſcoveries of his Glory, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 23. and 22. 4, 5. they ſhall ſee his Face.</p>
               <p>2. I ſay therefore, there is a double opening of the Temple: One before the Vial Angels go forth to let them out, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 6. Another, after the Vials are poured out, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 19. joined with judging the Dead and rewarding the Saints, <hi>v.</hi> 18. Or often things are ſpoken abſolutely, which are to be underſtood com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively; and ſo he doth not deny abſolutely that there is any opening of the Temple till the ſeventh Trumpet, but comparatively. At the former opening before the Vials, few in Compariſon enter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 8. no Man could enter, till the ſeven Plagues of the ſeven Vials were fulfilled, <hi>i. e.</hi> till the latter Vials, few entred; but at the latter opening, many enter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15, 19. the Kingdoms of the World are the Lord's and his Chriſt's; and this is not before the ſeventh Vial.</p>

                  <hi>THe [Seven Vials] are ſo many Diſpenſations or Tempests of Divine Wrath; not upon the Saints, but upon the Papal and Antichriſtian World;</hi> upon the Worſhippers of the Beaſt, and thoſe

               <p>Hence [Earth, Sea, Rivers, Sun, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>] can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not here be taken literally; for that would bring as much hurt to the true Church, as to the Antichriſtian Party; but myſtically: for that which in the Papal or Antichriſtian World beareth a reſemblance unto Earth, Sea, Rivers, Sun—in the Natural World; and ſo the Beaſt's Earth is the Subject of the firſt Vial, his Sea the Subject of the ſecond Vial, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And obſerve that none of the Vials are pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, until after the ſecond Two-horned Beaſt, the Pope was up, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11. for till then, the Image of the Beaſt was not made, nor worſhipped, <hi>v.</hi> 14. it was he that cauſed all to receive a mark, <hi>v.</hi> 16. 17. and the very firſt Vial falleth upon thoſe that had the mark of the Beaſt, and did worſhip his Image, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 2. and he was not up in his Firſt Horn till <hi>Phocas, Ann.</hi> 606. and had not his Mark till after <hi>Ann.</hi> 1000. as I have proved; and ſeeing Seals were opened, and divers Trumpets ſounded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, hence they are much miſtaken who think that the firſt Seal, and the firſt Trumpet, and the firſt Vial do contemporate, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Alſo note, that the former Vials do alter, but do not utterly deſtroy the Subjects of them: and therefore it is not to be wondred at, if after theſe have been poured out, yet the Beaſt hath recovered again, and ſeemed to regain what he loſt; for even the fifth Vial is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98846:58"/>
not ſaid to deſtroy the Seat of the Beaſt, but to fill his Kingdom with Darkneſs, and only the ſixth and ſeventh Vials do deſtroy the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of them.</p>

               <p>I have before manifeſted that we are in the latter end of the ſixth Trumpet; and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Vials are already poured out, cometh now to be conſidered.

               <p>1. <hi>The [first Vial] was poured out upon [the Earth] i. e.</hi> the Popiſh Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 2.

               <p>And this alone may argue, that the Beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked ones, and his Image-worſhippers, were now ſmitten as with a noiſome Sore; For the Pope and his Party were ſo tormented, that it's ſaid, they condemned the Opinion and the Fautors of it as Hereticks, ſeeking their Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, warning Princes to take heed of them and baniſh them out of their Territories; they called Councils againſt <hi>Berengarius:</hi> One at <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Leo</hi> IX. about <hi>An.</hi> 1050. where upon his Letters to <hi>Lanfrancus,</hi> they condemned him
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98846:59"/>
(though abſent) as an Heretick. Another the ſame Year at <hi>Vercellis.</hi> Another by <hi>Victor</hi> II. at <hi>Tours,</hi> about <hi>An.</hi> 1055. Another Council aſſembled by Pope <hi>Nicolaus</hi> II. at <hi>Rome,</hi> about <hi>An.</hi> 1059. where <hi>Berengarius</hi> was preſent, and ſome ſay, they forced him to a Recantation; Others write, that he never recanted, or that he died in his Opinion about <hi>An. 1083. ib.</hi> and <hi>Bertold. Const.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Recantation of <hi>Berengarius</hi> (if he made any) cannot hinder his being inſtrumental in pouring out this Vial, ſeeing he diſowned his Recantation; and there were many others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him, that firmly taught the ſame true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and many Thouſands in ſeveral Nations ſtedfaſtly owned it, and couragiouſly oppoſed thoſe Corruptions of the Romiſh Church, to their great vexation.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> had their Falls, their Blemiſhes; ſo may Pourers out of Vials, for the hardening of their Enemies, and humbling of themſelves; which here I intimate once for all.</p>
               <p>And I conclude, that the firſt Vial was poured out by theſe <hi>Berengarians</hi> and <hi>Petro-Bruſians,</hi> becauſe this was the firſt eminent Storm of Wrath upon the Worſhippers and Marked ones of the Beaſt, or the firſt riſing out of the Dregs of Popery; the firſt remarkable open Separation from <hi>Rome,</hi> and is anſwerable to all that is ſaid of that Vial.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The ſecond Vial was poured out upon the Sea,</hi> Rev. 16. 3. <hi>i. e.</hi> upon the Popiſh Sea; and the Effect is, [it became as the Blood of a dead
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98846:59"/>
Man] <hi>i. e.</hi> without ſpirit, corrupt, filthy and deadly; for [every living ſoul in the Sea died] <hi>i. e.</hi> many in, or that were maintained by the Popiſh Sea, could no longer live and breath there.</p>
               <p>This [Sea] muſt either be the whole Papal Religion and Corrupt Doctrine wherein they Trade and Traffick about the Souls of Men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 13. with all their corrupt Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Conſtitutions, Forms, Ordinances and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip taken together. Or elſe [Sea] is the whole compaſs of the Papal Society, the Nations, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Kingdoms and Provinces of the Papal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion or Juriſdiction; thus Waters are taken, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 15. and Sea is a confluence or the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of Waters. The Explication of this ſecond Vial, and the manner of its pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out is found, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6, 7. and it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to many Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and People.</p>
               <p>This ſecond Vial was poured out by the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenſes</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes;</hi> for, (after the <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians)</hi> they were the next which were famous for making Oppoſition againſt, and Separation from the Pope and corrupt Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in them, all that is ſpoken of this Vial, was exactly fulfilled: For <hi>Waldus</hi> being converted about <hi>Ann.</hi> 1160. he Preached ſound Doctrine, as, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 7. Fear God, and worſhip him, <hi>i. e.</hi> do not worſhip Images, he and others called off from the Idolatry of <hi>Rome;</hi> Some called it the New Goſpel the Holy-Ghoſt, in oppoſition thereunto called it, the Everlaſting Goſpel, or poſſibly in oppoſition to what was falſly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98846:60"/>
for, <hi>Matth. Pariſ.</hi> about <hi>An.</hi> 1256. men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth a wicked Book made by the <hi>Jacobin</hi> Preaching-Friars, entituled. [<hi>The Everlaſting Goſpel</hi>] the deſign of which was to ſuppreſs the Goſpel of Chriſt, teaching that the ſtate of Grace did not proceed from the Law of the Goſpel, but from the Law of the Spirit; for ſo they called their Dreams and Revelations. Indeed this Book was ſo peſtiferous, that <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> ſaith, <hi>Alexander</hi> IV. cauſed it to be burnt; but it's ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Burning it was ſecretly, and by conſtraint; for he baniſhed <hi>Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de S. Amore</hi> who complained of it.</p>
               <p>Whether [Sea] be the whole Papal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or the Papal Society, made up of many Nations, either way theſe <hi>Waldenſes</hi> poured out a Vial upon it; ſhewing the corruptneſs and deadlineſs of their Religion and Worſhip in the complex Body of it, and this in many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Papal Kingdom, whereby many Thouſands were converted, and durſt drink no more of thoſe corrupt Doctrines, than of the Blood of a dead Man, and many that Traded in the Papal Sea, and had dependance upon it, loſt their Livelihoods, and ſo died civilly; as may be ſeen in the Hiſtories of them. Yea, even literally it was in part fulfilled; for when they raiſed Wars againſt theſe <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the Papal Party periſhed; it's ſaid, that in the Siege of <hi>Avignion</hi> were deſtroyed by Famine, Peſtilence and Drowning, more than Two and twenty Thouſand of the French Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>Acts and Mon.</hi> Part 1. p. 352. and many more died elſewhere; though afterward, by various
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98846:60"/>
ways, they did ſorely perſecute thoſe faithful Creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reinerius</hi> a Writer about their time, and an extream Enemy againſt them, yet is driven to confeſs this of them; That the Sect of the <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> hath a great ſhew of Holineſs, in that they both live juſtly before men, and believe all things contained in the Creed, only they do Blaſpheme the Romiſh Church, and hate it, <hi>&amp;c. ib. p.</hi> 301, 302. And he and others do conclude theſe <hi>Leoniſts</hi> to be of all other Sects (as they call them) moſt pernicious to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that for three cauſes. 1. Becauſe of longer continuance. 2. Becauſe more general almoſt in all Lands. 3. Becauſe of a ſhew of Piety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that this was upon the Papal Sea, even the Papal party themſelves being Judges. So <hi>Popliner. Hiſtor. Franc. l.</hi> 1. It was never more ſharply oppugned than by the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> their Doctrine (ſaith he) differeth but little from the now Proteſtants; <hi>Non per Galliam ſolum totam, ſed etiam per omnes penè Europae or as diſſeminarunt, nam Galli, Hiſpani, Angli, Scoti, Itali, Germani, Bohemi, Saxones, Poloni, Lithuani &amp; gentes aliae eam ad hunc diem pertinaciter defenderunt.</hi> So that Nations, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, Tongues and People, received the pure Goſpel, and forſook the deadly Roman See by their means. They ſpread into <hi>Picaray,</hi> whence they were called <hi>Picards;</hi> by Perſecution they did flie into <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Alſatia,</hi> where they ſpread their Doctrine: they had goodly Churches in <hi>Bulgary, Croatia, Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Hungary. Clarks Martyr.</hi> Where alſo ſee what their Doctrines and Opinions were, as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98846:61"/>
that the Maſs was an Abomination, the Hoſt an Idol, and Purgatory a Fable, they declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt Popiſh Holy Oil with Baptiſm, Canonical hours, Auricular Confeſſion, Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Images<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indulgences. Praying for the Dead, and many others, even the See of the Romiſh corrupt Doctrines, and made it as a Dead Sea, and ſo was the ſecond Vial.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The Third Vial was poured out upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Fountains of Waters, Rev.</hi> 16. 4. which come from the Sea, and return thither again. And if Sea in the former Vial be the confluence of corrupt Doctrine (as Waters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſignifie Doctrine <hi>Ezek. 47. 4, 5. Iſa.</hi> 11. 9. and 55. 1.) then the Rivers are ſome particular corrupt Doctrines, or ſome Doctors or Emiſſaries of the Romiſh Church. Or if Sea there was the confluence of Nations and Kingdoms, making up the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal juriſdiction, as Waters ſignifie <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 15. Then Rivers and Fountains denote ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nations or Kingdoms within the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Dominion.</p>
               <p>And the effect of this Vial is, that theſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 4. become blood, <hi>i. e.</hi> they become bloody much of the Blood of the Papal party is ſhed there, as <hi>v.</hi> 6. thou haſt given them blood to drink, for they are worthy. And there is a double atteſtation of the righteouſneſs and equity of it: the Lord is declared True and Righteous in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98846:61"/>
Rev.</hi> 19. 2. Hence I take this Vial to be as a Seſſions or a Preludium, as it were a Type, and that Fall of <hi>Babylon (Rev.</hi> 18.) like a great Aſſize. And therefore this third Vial is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, <hi>Rev. 14 8. Babylon</hi> is fallen, is fallen—this cannot be the great fall of it, for after this ſeveral other Angels have Vial work, <hi>v.</hi> 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to end, whereas after the great Fall of <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 18. there is only one Vial to follow at <hi>Armageddon, Rev.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>This Third Vial was poured out by the <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffites</hi> and <hi>Huſſites,</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and others about <hi>Ann.</hi> 1370 and after: for, then there was a diſtinct guſt of wrath upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Party and Doctrine, as the next remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blow after that of the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes;</hi> and this was anſwerable to all that is ſaid of this Vial, which falleth only upon the Rivers and Fountains, not upon the Popiſh Sea. In that dark time they did famouſly Witneſs for Chriſt againſt the Pomp, Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> of the Pope, to the bringing multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes off from his corruptions. They held ſuch doctrines as theſe, That the ſubſtance of Bread remained in the Sacrament, after the words of Conſecration, that the People ſhould have it in both kinds; they declared againſt Popiſh Pardons, Indulgences and Corporal Unction, as a Sacrament, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Council at <hi>Conſtance</hi> was aſſembled by the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> and Pope <hi>John 23. Ann.</hi> 1414. where a Sentence of Condemnation was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out againſt the Doctrine of <hi>John Wickliffe,</hi> and his Bones ordained to be raiſed out of his Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98846:62"/>
and to be Burnt. Alſo notwithſtanding the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> ſent for <hi>John Huſs</hi> to the Council, and promiſed him ſafe conduct, yet they condemned <hi>John Huſs,</hi> and though the Nobles and Lords of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> did challenge the ſafe Conduct, yet they Condemned and Burnt him, and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> was Burnt alſo.</p>
               <p>And I cannot without admiration obſerve, how anſwerable the event was to the effect of this Vial, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 4, 5, 6. 7. which may further confirm it, and render it undoubted, that now this Vial was poured out;</p>
               <p>For a Nobleman named <hi>Ziſca,</hi> being ſore grieved for the Death of <hi>John Huſs</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> minding to revenge the injuries which the Council had done greatly to the diſhonour of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> he gathered together a number of Men of War, and ſubverted the Monaſteries, and Idolatrous Tem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Ziſca</hi> took many Places, deſtroyed Monaſteries in the Territory of <hi>Pelzina,</hi> put the Emperour to Flight. He with his power entreth again into <hi>Bohemia</hi> with a great Army,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98846:62"/>
but the Emperour afraid of <hi>Ziſca,</hi> fled again, and many of his Nobles were ſlain. <hi>Ziſca</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the Emperour a days journey, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained this Victory, would not ſuffer any Image or Idol to be in the Churches, nor Prieſts to Miniſter with Copes or Veſtments. The Reformed obtained another great victory, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nobles of their Enemies ſlain, and 9000 common Souldiers. In the Epitaph of <hi>Ziſca,</hi> it is ſaid that he was a ſevere puniſher of the Pride and Avarice of the Clergy, that eleven times in joining Battel he went Victor out of Field. See <hi>Acts and Mon. vol. 1. p. 848, &amp;c.</hi> out of <hi>Aeneas Silvius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Death of <hi>Ziſca, Sigiſmund</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour which Burned <hi>Huſs</hi> and <hi>Jerom,</hi> is fain to intreat for his Kingdom. Pope <hi>Martin</hi> then perceiving the Goſpel to increaſe daily more and more, ſent into <hi>Germany</hi> to move them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to War againſt the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> whereunto alſo the Emperour did aſſiſt. There were three Armies provided, which joined together, but when the news came that the Reformed had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered an Army and came with all ſpeed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, they fled before they ſaw their Enemies, leaving great Prey. The Cardinal meeting them in their flight, marvelled at their Cowardlineſs, and intreated them to turn again to their Enemies, but all in vain: The <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians</hi> coming upon the rereward, and then their flight was more diſordered and fearful than before, neither did they leave flying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Bohemians</hi> left following; the Hoſt of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> was greatly enriched. <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:98846:63"/>
the Emperour having news of theſe things ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered new help; alſo Pope <hi>Martin</hi> ſent into <hi>Germany,</hi> and a new Expedition is decreed againſt the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and ſeveral Biſhops, as of <hi>Mentz, Trevers</hi> and <hi>Cologne</hi>—ſent their aids. The <hi>Bohemians</hi> made ready, but there fell ſuch a ſudden fear amongſt all the Papiſts throughout the whole Camp, that they began moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to run away before any Enemy appeared in ſight, and by all the intreaties of Cardinal <hi>Julianus</hi> would not return. Thus the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fear of their Enemies made the more bold, and couragious, purſued them, and had great prey and ſpoil, and the <hi>Bohemians</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered ſo long, as they could agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>And now judge whether theſe acts of <hi>Ziſca,</hi> and other <hi>Bohemians</hi> upon a reformed account, ſo wonderfully prevailing againſt the Popiſh party, were not the pouring out of the Third Vial upon the Rivers and Fountains, and the effect thereof, whereby they became blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 4. and the Angel of the Waters giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth glory to God for judging thus, rendering this reaſon, <hi>v.</hi> 6. for they have ſhed the Blood of thy Saints and Prophets, and thou haſt given them blood to drink, for they are worthy. So <hi>v.</hi> 7. It was for ſhedding the Blood of the Saints, <hi>John Huſs,</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and others, that theſe Wars were raiſed by <hi>Ziſca</hi> and the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and here the Lord gave the Popiſh party, (who are the proper ſubjects of this Vial) of their own blood to drink, and therefore doubtleſs here was the third Vial poured out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:98846:63"/>I have the more inſiſted upon it, becauſe it is given by the Holy Spirit, as an emblem or lively reſemblance of the great deſtruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> at <hi>Rome, Rev.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Theſe exploits of <hi>Ziſca</hi> and the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> I am apt to think were a lively picture or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation thereof, even in the very manner of it, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſome purely profeſſing Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der like <hi>Ziſca,</hi> upon a religious account for injuries offered to the Saints, and ſo as the mighty Romiſh Armies ſhall be ſtruck with conſternation or a pannick fear, and flee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſight of their Enemies.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The fourth Vial was poured out upon the [Sun,] Rev.</hi> 16. 8, 9. the effect is, [Power was given him to ſcorch men with fire.] That which in the Antichriſtian World, reſembleth the Sun in the Natural World, muſt be the ſubject of this Vial: and therefore the Pope is this [Sun] upon which the wrath of this Vial falleth: For, he is the greateſt, moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, and glorious light there, which they ſay, ſo derives light to the very Scriptures, that they are counted authentical, and their ſenſe, received Doctrine, Worſhip, Councils, Decrees, only as they borrow light from him for their ratification, and therefore he is this Sun. Yea as if it were purpoſely to intimate ſo much, the Emperour writeth to the Pope and ſaith, We are both appointed of God as two great lights, <hi>&amp;c. Sleidan. Comment. l.</hi> 6. and after <hi>Innocent.</hi> III. maketh the Biſhop or Prieſt much more excellent than the other. Look what difference is betwixt the Sun and the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98846:64"/>
Moon, ſo great a diverſity is there betwixt the office of a High-Biſhop, and a Kings Office, <hi>ib li.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Upon this [Sun] the Pope, did <hi>Luther</hi> and other Worthies about <hi>Ann.</hi> 1517. and after pour out ſuch a Vial of Wrath, as never any did the like before, Papiſts themſelves being Judges. He writ a Book wherein he ſaith, that the See of <hi>Rome</hi> is nothing elſe but the Kingdom of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the power of the ſtrong hunter <hi>Nimroth;</hi> when they Burnt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> works, he burnt the Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> Law, and the Decree then lately publiſhed openly. <hi>Ib. l.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Calvin, Melancthon, Zwinglius,</hi> and many others, as well as <hi>Luther,</hi> ſcorched men with Fire, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 8. and this is a ſure Direction when this Vial was poured out, <hi>viz.</hi> when men by their Preachings, Writings, Diſputations, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> denounced Fire and Brimſtone, and the greateſt Torments againſt ſuch Worſhippers, and ſo it is explained, <hi>Rev. 14. v.</hi> 9, 10, 11.

The ſame ſhall drink the Wine of the Wrath of God poured out without mixture—and ſhall be [torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Fire and Brimſtone] which was clearly fulfilled in <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvins</hi> time.</p>
               <p>How many Countreys and Kingdoms by ſuch Preaching fell off from <hi>Rome,</hi> and took up Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as deſiring to preſerve themſelves from that Fire, which therefore ſcorched the Papal party?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:98846:64"/>After a Diſputation, Religion was Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only at <hi>Bernes,</hi> but alſo proclaimed by Magiſtrates in ſundry places thereabouts, Maſſes, Altars, Images, aboliſhed in all places. They wrote the day and year wherein they forſook the Popiſh Religion upon a Pillar, in Golden Letters, that it might be an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing memorial to their Poſterity.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe they of <hi>Geneva</hi> did imitate them of <hi>Bernes,</hi> wherefore the Biſhop and Clergy forſook the City in anger.

               <p>Another ſymptom of its being then poured out is, the great following perſecutions, raiſed by the <hi>Beſtians</hi> being incenſed by the torment of this fire, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 12.

               <p>All which was manifeſtly accompliſhed, for after <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> and others had proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fire againſt the worſhippers of the Beaſt, they repented not, witneſs the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> wherein they ſought to eſtabliſh their Abominations, and then followed the great and ſore Perſecutions in moſt Kingdoms of the

               <p>5. <hi>The fifth Vial is poured out upon the Throne of the Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 16. 10. and the effect is, [his Kingdom is full of Darkneſs,] and they have anguiſh and indignation, [gnawed their Tongues—]</p>
               <p>[Throne] either is, the Government of the Beaſt, his Soveraignty and Authority, (as <hi>Pſal. 89. 36, 37.

               <p>I know many think the City of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Throne of the Beaſt which this Vial falleth upon; but the City of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Woman, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 18. or whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which ſitteth upon the Beaſt, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and ſo cannot be the Throne which the Beaſt ſitteth upon.

               <p>
                  <hi>Italy</hi> was Alarmed by the report of ſo great proſperity—</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swede</hi> ſtill goeth on (though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome checks) and even after the death of <hi>Guſtave,</hi> yet often had great ſucceſſes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed much againſt the <hi>German</hi> Emperour, and at laſt forced him to ſtoop to ſuch terms, as he could make with him.</p>
               <p>And now judge whether the fifth Vial was not here poured out upon <hi>Germany,</hi> as the Throne, or Chief Kingdom of the Ten-horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beaſt? For this War was ſtated between the [Beaſts party] of the one part, to the ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great terrour into the Hearts, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing ſo many thouſands of them, and the [Proteſtants] as the other party. And ſeeing this is a diſtinct ſtorm upon that party, after four Vials had been poured out, what can this be but the fifth Vial? and the rather becauſe all things anſwer to it, even as to effects. As,</p>
               <p>The whole Kingdom of the Beaſt was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 10. even by that one blow gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus;</hi> did it not ſuffer a greater Eclipſe of its eſteem and glory at that day, than ever before? even at <hi>Jankow</hi> Battel,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98846:67"/>
                  <hi>March</hi> 6. 1645. there was a moſt ſenſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat to the Imperial Party; for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it left <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> as a Prey, and opened the Paſſage into <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia,</hi> and the Emperours Hereditary Lands, as far as the <hi>Danube.</hi> Every one thought that the Emperour was loſt, if the Swedes chanced to paſs the <hi>Danube.</hi> They were in great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſee the Swedes at one and the ſame time at the Gates of <hi>Vienna, Copenhaghen</hi> and <hi>Bremen,</hi> every where treading down their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, <hi>

                     </gap>b. Part 2. c.</hi> 16. This therefore was the fifth Vial, which ſeemed to have ſpent its greateſt Strength, and to be drawing towards a Concluſion, when the Pacification was made in <hi>Germany,</hi> or Peace, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1649. but ſome Effects may have continued ſince.</p>
               <p>Neither will this deny it to be that Vial, that the Effect of the German War fell as heavy upon God's People there, as his Enemies.</p>
               <p>For, at the firſt hand, here was a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between the People of God and others. And however, in ſome of the firſt Plagues in <hi>Egypt</hi> (to which the Vials allude) the Lord made no diſtinction between the Iſraelites and the Egyptians, till <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 22.</p>
               <p>And further, the Effect of this Vial is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 10, 11. they gnawed their Tongues for pain, and blaſphemed God—and repented not. Which argue the indignation, vexation, rancour and extremity of Rage, which the Beaſts Party ſhall be filled with, by the pouring out of this Vial upon them, and ſo they not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their Evil way without repentance, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming God, but like diſtracted Mad-men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:98846:68"/>
they ſeek to revenge their own quarrel by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon and raiſing bitter Perſecutions againſt the Proteſtant Party; and therefore, this is but an expected iſſue of the Kingdom-filling dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Tongue-gnawing Pain, an event of this Vial, and ſo rather a Confirmation of its being then poured out.</p>
               <p>Neither will this deny that German War to be a Vial, becauſe the Empire is yet ſtanding.</p>
               <p>For, I ſee no Scripture-Evidence, that any Vial (except the 6th or 7th) do bring a Total Deſtruction upon the Subjects on which they fall: for if the Beaſts Earth, Sea, Rivers and Fountains, had been utterly deſtroyed by the three former Vials, there could have remained nothing for ſeveral other Vials to be poured out upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe compriſing the whole Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian World. And this fifth Vial doth but darken, not utterly deſtroy the Kingdom of the Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 10. and ſo the German Empire may be yet ſtanding after that Vial is poured out upon it, as <hi>Egypt</hi> was darkened before <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and the Egyptians were deſtroyed. And immediately before that Vial which deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Whore, ſhe fitteth as a Queen, ſaying, ſhe ſhall ſee no ſorrow, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 7. and how could ſhe ſit in ſuch Pomp, if former Vials had cauſed an utter Deſtruction of what they fell upon?</p>
               <p>In ſhort, either <hi>Rome</hi> cannot be the Throne which this fifth Vial is poured out upon, (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then they repented not, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 10, 11.) or elſe it cannot be the Tenth part, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 13.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98846:68"/>
for then they repent. And if the fifth Vial was poured out in <hi>Germany,</hi> then we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the latter part of that, or the beginning of the ſixth Vial.</p>
               <p>That which followeth is moſtly hereafter to be fulfilled, or in a great part to come.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>The ſixth Vial is poured out upon the great River</hi> Euphrates, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 12. The Effects of it are, the drying up the Waters thereof, and war-like Preparations, <hi>v.</hi> 12. to 17.</p>
               <p>The Subjects of the other Vials are not Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but Myſtical or Metaphorical; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Euphrates</hi> is not to be underſtood literally here, of that very River, eſpecially ſeeing all the ſeven are Plag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore the River [<hi>Euphrates</hi>] here muſt notifie, either, that which is the ſtrength of Myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> as <hi>Euphrates</hi> was of Literal <hi>Babylon:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or elſe the People inhabiting about <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> which are the Turks. The Event will be the beſt Interpreter of the Propheſie.</p>
               <p>If [<hi>Euphrates</hi>] be the ſtrength of Myſtical <hi>Babylon;</hi> then as the drying up literal <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> was the means of taking Literal <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſo the drying up here importeth the great means of the deſolation or downfall of Myſtical <hi>Babylon.</hi> And [Waters] being Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, People, Nations and Tongues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 15. hence the drying up of theſe, is by the

               <p>Or elſe [<hi>Euphrates</hi>] muſt be the Turks the People that inhabit about <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which is but once more mentioned in this Book, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 14.) and there referreth to the Turks.</p>
               <p>The [Waters] are, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 15. People, Multitudes, Nations and Tongues—</p>
               <p>By this Vial theſe Waters are dried up, <hi>i. e.</hi> waſted, conſumed, vaſt Numbers, great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the Turkiſh People are deſtroyed, or many Nations fall off from the Turks, ſo as they loſe much of their Power and Dominion, and ceaſe to be a Wo to the Romaniſts; when this cometh to paſs, the ſixth Vial is pouring out. By what ways and means this will be; whether by Inteſtine Diſcords, or ſome exterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98846:69"/>
Enemy, the Event muſt determine. The Angel that poureth out this Vial cometh out of the Temple, as well as others, and is clothed in pure and white Linnen, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 6. and ſo it ſeemeth not to be primarily or only by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Diſcord, nor by the Antichriſtian Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, as Vial Angels; but Jeſus Chriſt may imploy theſe in the deſtructive work, daſhing Enemies as Potſheards one againſt another, as a fruit of the Prayers of Saints.</p>
               <p>As the former Vials were much poured out by Preaching; ſo the two laſt by Prayer. A Vial Angel out of the Temple ſolliciteth Jeſus Chriſt (the Angel on the white Cloud) to thruſt in his Sickle and reap a Harveſt, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down his Enemies, and he doth it as a return of Prayer, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 14, 15, 16. and this, I think, doth contemporate with, and is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this ſixth Vial. And thus the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel is in white Linnen under a pure Profeſſion, who poureth out the Vial in a way of Prayer, but it is referred to Jeſus Chriſt to do the work, and he may and oft doth make Enemies Executioners of his Wrath upon one an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

the drying up of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> either of Myſtical <hi>Babylon, Rome,</hi> or the conſuming of Turkiſh People and Power, it is to this intent, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for this end, to make way for that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient People of God the Jews, to return to their own Land, and unto God.

               <p>Some think that the Deſtruction of <hi>Rome</hi> is not till this ſeventh Vial, becauſe of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>

                  </gap> that, there is a rejoycing for the deſolation of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Rev. 19. which this Opinion would leave no room for.</p>
               <p>I therefore ſay, there is a double remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of <hi>Babylon,</hi> one under the ſixth, the other under the ſeventh Vial.

               <p>And thus the Holy-Ghoſt diſtinguiſheth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 15. to the end. The Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> is the Harveſt; the utter Extirpation of <hi>Babylon</hi> at the ſeventh Vial is the Vintage, which will quickly follow the other, as the Vintage doth the Harveſt.</p>
               <p>The [Hail] out of Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 21. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the more immediate Judgments of God on the Enemies at that Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Concluſion</hi> of all then is, that we are to wait by Faith and Patience, for thoſe great things which are yet unfulfilled; for the great Day of the Lord is near. And the things that are ſtill unaccompliſhed, and yet to come, <hi>An.</hi> 1680, and ſo to be expected, are ſuch as theſe that follow:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Death-ſtate of the Witneſſes, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion,</hi> Rev. 11. 7. to <hi>v.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>Their Death is ſignalized by various Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters aforementioned; eſpecially by the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, blackneſs and gloomineſs of the Day, with the loſs of a Witneſſing-Spirit after fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing their Teſtimony. This is the Comfort, that it will be ſhort, and the iſſue glorious. Their recovery is notified by a great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98846:72"/>
or Commotion, <hi>v.</hi> 13. we may know they are riſen, if after that there be a Fall of a famous Tenth part of the Old Roman Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and the Ruine of a vaſt Number of Dignitaries, Officers, Men of Eminency and Renown by the Earthquake, and the repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Remnant, ſo as to give Glory to God.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The waſting and diminiſhing of Turkiſh Power, ſo as it ceaſeth to be a Wo to the Idolatrous Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> Rev. 11. 14. the ſecond Wo is paſt—This is an immediate iſſue of the Witneſſes Aſcenſion, not only in Viſion, but in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the fifth, or former Wo-Trumpet was concluded in the ſame manner, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Event; and alſo it is added ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, the Third Wo cometh quickly.</p>
               <p>Not that the utter Deſtruction of the Turks, or of his whole Dominion every where, will be at the Aſcenſion of the Witneſſes; no, that is not till afterwards at the ſeventh Vial, as I ſhall evidence: but they ſhall abundantly loſe Ground and ſuffer a Conſumption of a vaſt Number of People, (by revolt, or otherwiſe) not only in <hi>Europe,</hi> in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> but in <hi>Africa</hi> or in <hi>Aſia,</hi> near the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where they were firſt looſe, and did over-run the Nations to the killing a third part of Men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 14, 15. and this waſting or deſtroying their Power and Dominion about <hi>Euphrates,</hi> this drying up that deluge of Inhabitants there, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 12. [that the way of the Kings of the Eaſt may be prepared] <hi>i. e.</hi> either as an occaſion for Enemies combining againſt Chriſt; or that a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98846:72"/>
paſſage may be open for the Jews return to their own Land, (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 49. 22.) which they ſtood in the way of, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11. 14. They ſhall fly upon the Shoulders of the Philiſtines to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Weſt, they ſhall ſpoil them of the Eaſt together, <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe that have been Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the People of God, as the Philiſtines were, ſhall march towards the Weſt, and ſpoil the Turks of the Eaſt, ſo as to make way for the Jews repoſſeſſing of their own Land. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Philiſtines ſhall do it intentionally or accidentally, God ſo over-ruling by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as their ſpoiling of the Turk ſhall give advantage to the Jews return; wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully removing all impediments and hindrances that were in the way of it; this I ſhall not here determine.</p>
               <p>All the Twelve Tribes ſhall return from all Quarters, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 14, 15. from <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> from <hi>Egypt—Edom, Moab,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Ammon</hi> ſhall be ſubject to them. And when the Turkiſh Power ſhall be thus waſted, either in <hi>Pathros</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> or about <hi>Euphrates,</hi> or both, then I ſhall expect the ſpeedy riſing or reſtitution of the Jews.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The downfall of Myſtical</hi> Babylon <hi>at</hi> Rome, <hi>Rev. 11. 13. Rev. 18. 2. Babylon</hi> the Great, is fallen, is fallen; ſo throughout the Chapter. Not only her Superſtition and Idolatry, her corrupt Offices, Orders, Ways, Worſhip, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize there, will be deſtroyed as a Mercy, but the City it ſelf of <hi>Rome</hi> for her Sins will ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably fall under ſudden and unavoidable Divine Wrath as a Sore Judgment, utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98846:73"/>
ſhall be burnt with Fire; ſo as the People of God are to avoid her Plagues, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and even her Friends ſhall be afraid of her Torments, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 8, 9, 10.—She is threatned with the ceaſing of the Voice of Mirth of the Bridegroom, and of the ſounding of the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and of the ſhining of Light, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23. which Phraſes generally note an utter Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 34. and 16. 9. and 25. 10, 11. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 24. 8, 9. and it is expreſly declared, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 16. where we have the way and means of her Ruine and Deſtruction. [The Ten Horns ſhall hate the Whore, and ſhall make her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, and ſhall eat her Fleſh, and ſhall burn her with Fire] <hi>i. e.</hi> Some of the Ten Horns who abominate her Idolatry ſhall make her deſolate, whether ſome in the Eaſtern Parts, or in the Weſt, or both, time muſt diſcover; others adhere ſtill in their Spirits to, and make Lamentation for her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 9. even thoſe that committed Fornication with her, and are thus diſtinguiſhed from thoſe who make her deſolate.</p>
               <p>Now the Symptoms and Signs of <hi>Romes</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Ruine, are ſuch as theſe: The ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated, meaſure-filling Sins of <hi>Babylon,</hi> her Plagues come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 5.

               <p>4. <hi>A Triumphant Song among the Saints, for the Ruine of</hi> Rome <hi>or</hi> Babylon <hi>there,</hi> Rev. 19. 1, 2, 3, 4. This ſeemeth to be about the latter end of the ſixth, or beginning of the ſeve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that when this is made good, all the Twelve Tribes, the Body of them, are re-united, ſo as they ſhall never be ſeparated any more, and one King ſhall be over them, <hi>David,</hi> v. 24. and that is Jeſus Chriſt, for <hi>David</hi> was dead long before this Propheſie. Few here yet know where the Ten Tribes are, and the two are ſtill ſcattered; ſo that this never was accompliſhed to this day, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt hereafter be fulfilled, becauſe God is true. This then is certain, That all the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall have a Poſſeſſion of their own Land again, and be under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion there; ſome think they ſhall not be converted till after they are there, <hi>Iſai. 61. 7.

               <p>The Way and Means of <hi>Iſraels</hi> return and Converſion, will be partly Extraordinary by

Impreſſions from the Lord, like wind breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, which will be to them as life from the dead, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 9, 11, 12. it will be a ſudden, unexpected thing, a Nation to be born in one day, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66. 8.</p>
               <p>Their Call will be partly by Ordinary means, the Preaching of the Goſpel, <hi>Jer. 31. 6, 8, 9, 10, &amp;c.</hi> by Watchmen on Mount <hi>Ephraim, Iſai.</hi> 52. 7, 8. and 59. 20. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60. 16.

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:98846:78"/>The attempt of this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> the Turk and his Adherents, will be ſpeedily after the reſtoration or return of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and dwelling ſafely in their own Land, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. 8, 9, 11, 15. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. 25, 26, 28, 29. when all the Twelve Tribes ſhall be newly gathered out of the Nations after their long ſcattering.</p>
               <p>And it will be a very dreadful and terrible deſtruction, by the fierceneſs of the wrath of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. 18. by a general Earth-quake or Commotion; by ſetting every Mans Sword among the Men of <hi>Gog</hi> againſt his Brother, by Peſtilence, Blood, and immediate Judgments, Hail-Stones, Fire and Brimſtone, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

               <p>And this great deſtruction of <hi>Gog</hi> or the Turk, will not be in <hi>Hungaria</hi> (though he may before have great loſſes there) but eſpecially in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> his great and laſt utter ruine and deſtruction ſhall be there, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. 4. thou ſhalt fall upon the Mountains of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               <p>This is further confirmed from, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. where the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> are called Kings of the South, and thoſe of <hi>Syria,</hi> Kings of the North, till both were tranſlated to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and then even in order of ſtory it is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 36.

Ezek.</hi> 38 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15. it cannot but be a time of Trouble every where, eſpecially ſeeing it will be attended with ſuch aſtoniſhing Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, <hi>Mat</hi> 24. 29. the Sun ſhall be darkened and the Moon ſhall not give her Light, and the Stars ſhall fall from Heaven, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken. And this refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to the ſame time, for as the next thing, <hi>v.</hi> 30. then ſhall appear the ſign of the Son of Man in Heaven.—And Jeſus Chriſt himſelf explaineth this, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 25, 26, 27. There ſhall be ſigns in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars, and upon the Earth diſtreſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with perplexity, Mens hearts failing for fear—and then they ſhall ſee the Son of Man coming in the Clouds,—<hi>i. e.</hi> for their relief and ſuccour.</p>
               <p>Theſe Univerſal Commotions will occaſion a very great conſternation and affrightment, yet Jeſus Chriſt giveth them as a Comforting Cordial to the Faith of the Saints, like the budding of the Fig-tree; which evidenceth that the Summer is near, <hi>v.</hi> 28. 29, 30, 31.</p>
               <p>So theſe terrible things argue that the Redemption of Believers draweth nigh, <hi>v.</hi> 32. Verily,—this Generation ſhall not paſs away till all be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>[This Generation] cannot be meant of that wherein this was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpoken by Chriſt on Earth; for that, and many Generations are paſſed ſince, and yet the things are unfulfilled: But in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98846:80"/>
other Evangeliſts, eſpecially <hi>Luke,</hi> it is applied to the Parable of the Fig-tree, [that Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion] <hi>v.</hi> 28. when the Fig-tree ſhall begin to put forth by theſe Diſtreſſes of Nations and Mens hearts failing for fear of thoſe things, which are coming on the Earth, [this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion] wherein theſe things begin, ſhall not paſs until all be fulfilled, <hi>i. e.</hi> till the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God ſhall come, <hi>v.</hi> 31. till they ſhall ſee the Son of Man coming in a Cloud, <hi>v.</hi> 27. All ſhall be accompliſhed in the very ſame Age or Generation wherein they have their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Thoſe things will have a terrible Aſpect even to the Saints; yet they will iſſue in their Redemption, <hi>v.</hi> 28. and the blow will fall upon Enemies in their great deſtruction, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. 20, 21, 22. and 39. 4, 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 18, 19, 20. ſo that this will be the greateſt trouble to the Enemies of Chriſt and his Church.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth that the greateſt trouble to the Jewiſh Nation will be over before this; For it is ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 29, 30. Immediately after the Tribulation of thoſe days, ſhall the Sun be dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened—and then ſhall appear the ſigns of the Son of Man.—</p>
               <p>This foregoing trouble is applied to the Jews, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. and is expreſly declared to be their greateſt Tribulation, <hi>v.</hi> 21. for then ſhall be great Tribulation: ſuch as was not ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World to this time, nor ever ſhall be. So then, the Eclipſing of all Earthly Glory by diſtreſs of Nations (about the time of <hi>Armageddon</hi>) is not before, but immediately after that greateſt Tribulation to the Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98846:80"/>
is over and at an end. It began at <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> about <hi>Ann.</hi> 70. that was their greateſt in reſpect of the ſeverity and ſharpneſs of it; the Hiſtory is very Tragical, many Hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the Jews periſhed, and were made mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, by Famine, Sword and Captivity; their Houſes and Streets were filled with dead Men, Women and Children, ſo that thoſe alive could not Bury the Dead, that it was unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled, it paſſed any Plague formerly ſent by God, <hi>Joſeph. lib. 6. c.</hi> 14, 16. and <hi>lib. 7. c.</hi> 17. Then might be fulfilled, <hi>Zech. 14. v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. And that is their greateſt Tribulation in reſpect of Duration, it hath laſted above 1600 Years, and the Jews are not yet delivered.</p>
               <p>It is hard to conceive that any future trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of theirs ſhould exceed that which is paſt, and eſpecially ſeeing there are ſo many Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that after their return, they ſhould have no more ſuch Sorrow and Captivity as before, <hi>Jer. 31. 10, 11, 12. Ezek. 34. 12. 22. Zeph. 3. 15. Zech. 9. 8. Am.</hi> 9. 14, 15. they ſhall no more be pulled out of their Land; and ſo they ſhall not again have their Houſes rifled and Women raviſhed, nor go again into Captivity; as, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 2. And if ſo, then their greateſt trouble mentioned, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1. muſt be begun at <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> and is almoſt expired, the worſt of it is over; for there cannot be two greateſt troubles to them, and Chriſt ſaith, there ſhall never be like to them, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 21.) It is uſual for the Prophets in a few Lines, to expreſs that which is fulfilling many Hundred Years; and ſo here in a Verſe or two, may decipher the great and

long Tribulations of the Jews, and alſo their deliverance, and reach even to the laſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>v.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, thoſe words [And there ſhall be a time of Trouble, ſuch as never was ſince there was a Nation] may come in by a Parentheſis, diſcovering what ſhall intervene between <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>'s rejection, and <hi>Michael</hi>'s ſtanding up for their deliverance, even a long and ſore Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation.</p>
               <p>Or elſe they muſt refer to this general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, which will be unparallelled in reſpect of aſtoniſhment and affrightment, but they will be more afraid than hurt, for then at that time they ſhall be delivered.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>The ſetting up of the glorious Kingdom of Jeſus Christ, the New</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>or the Glory of the Church here a Thouſand Years,</hi> Rev. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 21. and 22.</p>
               <p>The Riſe or firſt State of this Kingdom, will be ſpeedily after the Reſurrection of the Witneſſes, and the firſt Converſion of the Jews, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 12, 15. and before the Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years begin. This is the Kingdom of the Stone, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 34, 45. whoſe beginning will be ſmall, and its way unpeaceable and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom, conflicting with Enemies, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing againſt and breaking of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>v.</hi> 45. So that this is not begun, ſo long as the Enemies of Chriſt are the prevailing Party, every where.</p>
               <p>The ſecond State of this Kingdom, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin next after the Battel at <hi>Armageddon,</hi> this will be more Peaceable and Glorious, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2. 4.

                  <hi>Mic.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 6, 7. The Church will enjoy great Liberty; for, her grand Enemy, the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, will be under a wonderful Reſtraint, will be Bound a Thouſand Years, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20 2.</p>
               <p>It cannot note the State of the Saints to come in Heaven upon the Judgment of the Great Day; for, after that Satan will be looſed no more; whereas, after this, <hi>v.</hi> 3 8. he ſhall be looſed for a little ſeaſon to deceive the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, after which, will ſpeedily follow that laſt Day of Judgment, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 9, 11, 12. but of that day and hour knoweth no man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 36.</p>
               <p>And it cannot be paſt; for the Dragon hath never been bound a Thouſand Years hitherto. The firſt Three hundred Years of Chriſt, he he was looſe, ruling by Pagan Emperours, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 3. 4. And ſince hath been looſe, ſending forth not only Papiſm, but Mahumetiſm, out of the bottomleſs Pit after <hi>An. 600. Rev. 9. 1, 2, &amp;c.</hi> which continue to this day; therefore he is not yet ſhut up in the bottomleſs Pit, and bound there, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 1, 2, 3. and conſequently the Thouſand Years are not yet begun. And beſides, when the Thouſand Years are expired, Satan is looſed again, and his Party is deſtroyed in an immediate way, by fire from God out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and he is caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone [where the Beaſt and the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet are]. Therefore the Beaſt and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet muſt be deſtroyed before the Thouſand Years begin; elſe how could the Dragon be caſt into the Lake where they were, if they had not been there before? and they are not there as yet, and ſo that time is not yet begun. They
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98846:82"/>
cannot be caſt in during the Thouſand Years, for Satan is bound all that time; whereas he is looſe till they be in the Lake, and immediately before the Beaſt and falſe Prophet were caſt in, the Dragon was not bound there, but aſſiſted them at the Battel at <hi>Armageddon,</hi> Rev. 16. 13. 16. and ſo that time of a Thouſand Years is not yet begun.</p>
               <p>And this Thouſand Years will be a glorious time; not Abſolutely, as if Sinleſs; but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, or compared with any former ſtate of the Church ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo it will be a ſtate of Bleſſedneſs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11, 12.

Now will <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s City and Temple be erected, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. to the End of that Book, the glory of which will be, that the Name of it from that day ſhall be <hi>Jehovah Shammah,</hi> the Lord is there, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48. 35.

Hence it is impoſſible that <hi>Pagan Rome</hi> ſhould be both Beaſt and Dragon: Neither was there any State before Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> to make the Dragon-ſtate, ſeeing it was Pagan from the firſt.</p>
               <p>2. Rome <hi>whilſt Dragon, had a vaſtly different form and ſhape from what it had under the firſt Beaſt:</hi> In its Dragon-ſtate it had only ſeven Crowns, and theſe not upon the Horns, but upon the Heads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 3. but at the riſing of the firſt Beaſt, there were Ten Crowns, and theſe upon the Horns, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1. for the <hi>Goths, Vandals,</hi> &amp;c. obtained a Soveraignty, ſetting up in the Empire for themſelves; whereas in the days of <hi>John,</hi> they had not received Power as Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12. all then (though ſome were named Kings, <hi>Mat. 2. 1, 3. Luk. 1. 5. Act.</hi> 26. 2, 7, 27.) being under the headſhip of, and in ſubjection to Emperours; but were to be Crowned about the ſame time when the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire turned Beaſt; were not ſo crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under Pagan <hi>Rome;</hi> therefore that was not the firſt Beaſt.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>After crowning the Horns, one of the Heads of the first Beaſt was wounded as unto death, and healed again,</hi> Rev. 13. 3. This cannot be proved of Pagan <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo that is not the firſt Beaſt.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The firſt Beaſt had Power to continue or make War 42 Months,</hi> Rev. 13. 5. if they were literal Months, Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> was Idolatrous and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Church much longer, even Hundreds of Years. If they be taken for Months of Years, then Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> did not continue half ſo long, and ſo cannot be that firſt Beaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:98846:83"/>5. <hi>It doth not appear that the ten horns after Crowning did hate Pagan</hi> Rome, <hi>and burn it with fire,</hi> Rev. 17. 12, 16. and ſo that was not the firſt Beaſt: Nor was it the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> for, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. ſpeaketh not merely of the deſtruction of ſome Corruptions (as of Paganiſm) but of an utter deſolation of a City it ſelf; Compare it with <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. 9, 10, 11, 12. ſo that if it had been Rome <hi>Pagan,</hi> it would not have left that as a City after Paganiſm, for the Papacy to reign in.</p>
               <p>6 <hi>The Reaſons urged for Pagan</hi> Rome, <hi>being the firſt Beaſt and the Whore of Babylon, are not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, but eaſily anſwered;</hi> for they are moſtly built upon that common Miſtake, <hi>viz.</hi> That elſe <hi>Rome</hi> Papal muſt be the firſt Beaſt: whereas I have proved that firſt Beaſt to be a civil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting ſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> diſtinct from, and up long (even Hundreds of Years) before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Beaſt (which is Papal) did ariſe in his firſt Horn of Eccleſiaſtical Power, about <hi>Ann.</hi> 606. and ſo moſt of the Reaſons are enervated, or evaded at once. Hence the Pope is not the 7th &amp; 8th Head or King. It is uſual for [King] to ſignifie, not a particular Perſon, but <hi>a Species of Government, or a Race of many Succeſſively,</hi> Dan. 7. 17. and 8. 21. and 11. 5, 9, 11, 13, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 10. cannot intend par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons; for, Five Pagan perſecuting Emperours were not fallen in the days of <hi>John,</hi> and there were more to come than would make up the 7 or 8, for there were Ten Perſecutions; therefore it muſt be Five Species of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that then were fallen. If the [<hi>ſhort ſpace</hi>]

                  <hi>v.</hi> 10. be not meant of the ſtate of the firſt Beaſt before the 7th Head of Popes did ariſe, but of it; then it may intend the Pope from the time of his becoming the 7th Head by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Civil Supremacy over-topping Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and then his continuance may be but a [<hi>ſhort ſpace</hi>] comparatively with the whole time of Emperours.</p>
               <p>Obj 1. <hi>It is Idolatrous perſecuting Power that the Text deſcribeth, and none perſecuted but Emperours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Not only the Emperours, but the Beaſt by Crowned horns alſo perſecuted:</hi> However it is not ſaid that all the ſeven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heads did perſecute, but that ſtate did it which hath theſe. And often that is aſcribed to many, which is acted not by all, but by ſome or a few of them; as <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 16. compared with, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 9.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>Evince that the ſix Pagan Governments were Heads of Papal</hi> Rome.</p>

the Senate and Emperours, and the Senate had a hand in making Decrees; but Emperours had the Supream Power in the Adminiſtration of the Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> or in the Executive part of the Law; for, who will ſay that there were two Supream Powers at the ſame time there?

               <p>Take this Rule.</p>

                  <hi>A Correſpondency or agreeableneſs of ſome Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Events unto a Propheſie will not prove its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, if there he diſagreeableneſs in other things.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:98846:86"/>Thus, ſome obſerving great Sufferings of Churches at divers Seaſons about Three Years and half, have concluded theſe for the times of the Witneſſes Death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7, 9. and yet have been miſtaken, as I before evidenced. So others finding [<hi>Pagan Rome</hi>] to anſwer ſome Characters in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 4, 5, 6. as being great, and a Mother of Harlots and Abominations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have groundleſly concluded that to be [<hi>the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Whore of Babylon</hi>]. Whereas Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> was down (as I have proved) before the Scarlet-coloured Beaſt was up, which carrieth her, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 7. and before the Ten Horns were crowned, <hi>v.</hi> 12. and ſo that cannot be the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> here intended.</p>
               <p>But as to [<hi>the Whore of</hi> Babylon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.] all the Characters of her agree to <hi>Rome</hi> Papal, and ſo we may conclude that to be it. <hi>Rome</hi> undeniably is that great City which in the days of <hi>John reigned over the Kings of the Earth,</hi> Rev. 17. 18. though now it is not of the ſame Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude as then, yet it is the ſame City that now is the Seat of the Papacy.

               <p>But how unimaginable is it, that almoſt the whole Book of <hi>the Revelation</hi> ſhould be ſpent about <hi>Pagan Rome</hi> in the firſt Three Hundred Years after Chriſt's Nativity, and that all the great Events ſhould be paſſed over in a deep ſilence, which have been for many Hundreds of Years ſince; and this when they were ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable to the Church, and do ſo clearly and exactly anſwer the Propheſie which yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extendeth to the End of time, even to the Day of judgment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 11, 12?</p>
               <p>I might add, that as this Propheſie of the caſting down the Dragon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. tended greatly to the Conſolation of Chriſtian Jews and Gentiles in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ompliſhment in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times; if then, there were the firſt fruits of them; yet the principal, the chiefeſt part, the compleat fulfilling of them is yet to come For,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>All the Tribes, the dry bones muſt live:</hi> The two Sticks ſhall be one Stick, one Nation, and that in their own Land under <hi>David</hi> their King, Jeſus Chriſt, when they ſhall be no more two Nations, <hi>neither ſhall be divided into two Kingdoms any more at all,</hi> Ezek. 37. 5, 10, 14, 16, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. and they ſhall be converted, <hi>v. 14. I will put my ſpirit in you.</hi>—</p>
               <p>This ſpeaketh not of a Union of believing Jews and Gentiles under Jeſus Chriſt; but plainly of the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for one ſtick is for <hi>Judah</hi> and the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his Companions, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and the other for <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the ſtick of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and for not only [ſome] but [all] the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> his Companions; this muſt compriſe the Ten Tribes; and theſe muſt all be united, become one Nation, <hi>v, 19, 22. in the Land, in the Mountains of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and one King ſhall be to them all,</hi> v. 22. and this is Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 24. David, <hi>my ſervant, ſhall be King over them, and they all ſhall have one Shepherd</hi>—i. e. Jeſus
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98846:88"/>
Chriſt, for <hi>David</hi> was dead long before, and [<hi>David</hi>] often is put for Chriſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 23, 24 with <hi>Joh. 10. 11. Iſai.</hi> 55. 3. with <hi>Act. 13. 34. Hoſ.</hi> 3. 5.—</p>
               <p>Whereas they never yet were thus united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt in their own Land, but are a divided ſcattered People to this day.</p>
               <p>Therefore there is a time yet to come, when they ſhall be thus united under Jeſus Chriſt; for God is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no tittle of his Promiſe ſhall fail. The like is declared in many other Prophecies.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>All Iſrael ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 11. 26. and not only the Elect, the ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Jews, that <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in diſtinction from the Gentiles, <hi>v.</hi> 25. and after blindneſs or hardneſs happened to the Jews, ſo as they were caſt away and broken off for their unbelief, <hi>v.</hi> 15, 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Converſion of the Jews, of multitudinous number of that <hi>Iſrael</hi> is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>It will be ſuch as will be greater riches to the World; to the Gentiles than their fall was, <hi>v. 12. how much more their fulneſs?</hi> There is then a time coming, when there will be ſuch [a fulneſs of the Jews] as will uſher in the Converſion of a far vaſter Numbers than in the firſt Ages of the Goſpel, as the [<hi>how much more</hi>] doth evidence.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But there is no probability that all or moſt of the Common People of the Ten Tribes were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted; but only the Rulers, and Rich and Military Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. I think every individual Perſon or Family was not carried away:</hi> yet it is apparently untrue, that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98846:89"/>
only ſuch a ſmall number of them were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted. See 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 6, 18, 24, 26. 41. and 18. 9, 10, 11. there were ſuch vaſt numbers removed to various diſtant places, <hi>v.</hi> 6. as it is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 18. there was none left but the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> only; ſee <hi>v.</hi> 23. they bear the name of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And ſuch multitudes were brought from far to people the Country, and be placed in the room of them as are called [Nations] <hi>v.</hi> 24, 26, 41.</p>
               <p>Let it be granted that there muſt be a return anſwerable, and the converſion of ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude as were tranſported, and we need not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>All the Ten Tribes were in the Dominion of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>and had liberty to return.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> ſaith, [when <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave leave to the Jews after the 70 years captivity, to return to their own country, multitudes of them found themſelves ſo pleaſingly ſeated, and by continuance of time rooted in <hi>Babylonia,</hi> that they would not remove their habitation, but fixed there. There in time they grew to ſo great a Nation, and diſtinct a people, that they had a Prince of the captivity of their own blood, over them, and three famous Univerſities, <hi>Nehardea, Pombeditha</hi> and <hi>Soria,—Peter</hi>'s lot fell here—directs his Epiſtle to the diſperſed Jews in <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Bithinia</hi>—See <hi>Harmon. p.</hi> 335.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They did not ſo return as to anſwer the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Ezek.</hi> 37. for then they muſt now be in their own land, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23, 25. which they are not, Some of the Ten Tribes joined with <hi>Judah. 2 Chron.</hi> 11. 17, 18. When yet they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98846:89"/>
two Kingdoms. And they are as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two Kingdoms ſtill as they were of old, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23, 25, 26, 28. yea in Goſpel times we read <hi>Joh. 7. 35. of the diſperſed among the Gentiles.</hi> Therefore there is yet a time coming wherein they ſhall return to their own land and be converted.</p>
               <p>Obj. 3. <hi>But the two Nations or Sticks became one under</hi> Zorobabel <hi>as a type, and myſtically under Chriſt, and ſo Ezek.</hi> 37. was fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Anſ. 1. <hi>That</hi> Ezek. 37. <hi>had any part or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of its accompliſhment under</hi> Zorobabel, <hi>is an aſſertion wholly groundleſs:</hi> and ſo a bare denial of it is ſufficient till there be proof of it. By [<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>] often is meant Chriſt, and not a type of him, ſo as the firſt accompliſhment of it was in the days of the Meſſiah long after <hi>Zorobabel</hi> was dead. The Twelve Tribes, or two Nations were never united under <hi>Zorobabel</hi> that I can find, there might be ſome of them as there was, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 17, 18. when yet they were two Kingdoms, but the body of them returned not, <hi>Zorobabel</hi> was not their Prince for ever, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 25, 28. there will be a time when they ſhall be in their Land, and their Children, and their Childrens Children for ever, <hi>v.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Ezek. 37. was not fulfilled in the firſt ages of the Goſpel, or at the firſt coming of Chriſt:</hi> for, as Mr. <hi>Greenhill</hi> well obſerveth, then the Scepter <hi>ſhould not have departed, when</hi> Shiloh <hi>came, Gen.</hi> 49. 10, If the Meſſiah were King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> King over both Houſes united into one, the Scepter did not depart, but was advanced.</p>
               <p>This will appear further by their being ſtill ſcattered as here followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:98846:90"/>Obj. 4. <hi>The Epiſtle to the Hebrews, and that of</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> James, <hi>are directed not to the two Tribes only, but to the Twelve Tribes that are ſcattered abroad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. 1. <hi>This very objection evidenceth that even multitudes of the Twelves Tribes were ſtill ſcattered in thoſe Goſpel times, when the greateſt number of Jews and Iſraelites were converted, that hitherto have become Chriſtians:</hi> and they have had further ſcatterings ſince, which ſufficiently proveth that the Prophecies aforeſaid and many others of like nature, were not then accompliſhed; they were not then united in their own land: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a time yet coming wherein he that ſcattered <hi>Iſrael</hi> will gather him, <hi>Jer. 31. 10. Ezek.</hi> 37. 21.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Thoſe Epiſtles concerned not the Twelve Tribes in thoſe primitive times only, or chiefly in that age, and the time now paſt;</hi> but thoſe Epiſtles to the Hebrews, and of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> are directed to all the Tribes, and will be of uſe to them in the times yet to come, when they ſhall be converted.</p>
               <p>Obj. 5. <hi>Many of the Jews were converted in the Primitive times,</hi> Act. 21. 20. <hi>and in</hi> Conſtantine's <hi>time, and ſo</hi> Rom. 11. 26. <hi>was fulfilled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>The converſion of Jews in thoſe firſt ages of the Goſpel, do not anſwer Rom.</hi> 11. 26 for that was the time of their fall and blindneſs; not of their ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Thoſe myriades then are but few in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the time when all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved. Alſo as then there were great deſtructions of the Jews by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> &amp;c. ſo Chriſt telleth us <hi>Luk. 21 23, 24. That wrath ſhould be upon them, and they ſhould be troden down of the Gentiles; how long?
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98846:90"/>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled;</hi> and they are trodden down by the Turks until this day; all which evidence that their converſion and glory could not be in thoſe Primitive times; but the time is coming when they ſhall ſay as <hi>Mat. 23. 37. Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</hi> But their Converſion is ſuch a <hi>myſtery</hi> as it will be <hi>as life from the dead, Rom.</hi> 11. 15, 25. hardly any firſt fruits or appearances of it before hand, yet dry bones ſhall live, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> appear in her glory.</p>
               <p>And now we ſee Scripture grounds ſtill to pray for the downfall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the coming of the glorious Kingdom of Chriſt and the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and converſion of the Jews, yea of all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and we do not take the Name of God in vain, nor deprave the Chriſtian Faith, but diſcharge an important duty therein.</p>

immunity, from threatned Judgments, and ſo may be hardened to their ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, I know the expectations of ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men, are raiſed high of a deſtruction of the Beaſt or <hi>Rome,</hi> about four or five years hence, ſuppoſing that then will be the expiration of the 1260 days: whereas I think thoſe days ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired ſome years ſince, but that this was not the event to be expected upon their expiration. If thoſe worthy Men ſhould ſuffer a fruſtration of expectation, yet there is no cauſe for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of their Spirits, or for Enemies triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I do modeſtly, not confidently hope for ſome glorious events within in this Age, if not within few years, but it is upon other grounds, as</p>
               <p>1. <hi>From the number of Vials already poured out:</hi> indeed the accompliſhments of foregoing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, are indications of what events are next to follow, and a ſure guiding thread for our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to diſcover where we are.</p>

               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Eſpecially the death of the Witneſſes, by</hi> the darkneſs and dreadfulneſs of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> together with their Reſurrection, and the conſequences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are the moſt ſure prognoſticks and moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal marks of the approaching glorious ſtate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. to 16.</p>
               <p>And if any ſhould inquire whether the death of the Witneſſes be yet paſt?

No preceding time which men have fixed upon can anſwer the character of it, but when I conſider the marvelous and almoſt miraculous return of the <hi>Vandois</hi> to their places together, with the wonderful liberty, here eſtabliſhed in <hi>England</hi> by Law, and elſe where with ſome other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I have ſome hopes that it is paſt, and that the Reſurrection of the Witneſſes is begun, until I ſee to the contrary.
